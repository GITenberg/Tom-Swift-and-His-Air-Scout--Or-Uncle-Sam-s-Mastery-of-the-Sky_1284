CHAPTER I
</H3>

<H3 ALIGN="center">
A SKY RIDE
</H3>

<P>
"Oh Tom, is it really safe?"
</P>

<P>
A young lady&mdash;an exceedingly pretty young lady, she could be
called&mdash;stood with one small, gloved hand on the outstretched wing of
an aeroplane, and looked up at a young man, attired in a leather,
fur-lined suit, who sat in the cockpit of the machine just above her.
</P>

<P>
"Safe, Mary?" repeated the pilot, as he reached in under the hood of
the craft to make sure about one of the controls. "Why, you ought to
know by this time that I wouldn't go up if it wasn't safe!"
</P>

<P>
"Oh, yes, I know, Tom. It may be all right for you, but I've never been
up in this kind of airship before, and I want to know if it's safe for
me."
</P>

<P>
The young man leaned over the edge of the padded cockpit, and clasped
in his rather grimy hand the neatly gloved one of the young lady. And
though the glove was new, and fitted the hand perfectly, there was no
attempt to withdraw it. Instead, the young lady seemed to be very glad
indeed that her hand was in such safe keeping.
</P>

<P>
"Mary!" exclaimed the young man, "if it wasn't safe&mdash;as safe as a
church&mdash;I wouldn't dream of taking you up!" and at the mention of
"church" Mary Nestor blushed just the least bit. Or perhaps it was that
the prospective excitement of the moment caused the blood to surge into
her cheeks. Have it as you will.
</P>

<P>
"Come, Mary! you're not going to back out the last minute, are you?"
asked Tom Swift. "Everything is all right. I've made a trial flight,
and you've seen me come down as safely as a bird.  You promised to go
up with me. I won't go very high if you don't like it, but my
experience has been that, once you're off the ground, it doesn't make
any difference how high you go. You'll find it very fascinating. So
skip along to the house, and Mrs. Baggert will help you get into your
togs."
</P>

<P>
"Shall I have to wear all those things&mdash;such as you have on?" asked
Mary, blushing again.
</P>

<P>
"Well, you'll be more comfortable in a fur-lined leather suit,"
asserted Tom. "And if it does make you look like an Eskimo, why I'm
sure it will be very becoming. Not that you don't look nice now," he
hastened to assure Miss Nestor, "but an aviation suit will be
very&mdash;well, fetching, I should say."
</P>

<P>
"If I could be sure it would 'fetch' me back safe, Tom&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
"That'll do! That'll do!" laughed the young aviator. "One joke like
that is enough in a morning. It was pretty good, though. Now go on in
and tog up."
</P>

<P>
"You're sure it's safe, Tom?"
</P>

<P>
"Positive! Trot along now. I want to fix a wire and&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
"Oh, is anything broken?" and the girl, who had started away from the
aeroplane, turned back again.
</P>

<P>
"No, not broken. It's only a little auxiliary dingus I put on to make
it easier to read the barograph, but I think I'll go back to the old
system. Nothing to do with flying at all, except to tell how high up
one is."
</P>

<P>
"That's just what I don't care to know, Tom," said Mary Nestor, with a
smile. "If I could imagine I was sailing along only about ten feet in
the air I wouldn't mind so much."
</P>

<P>
"Flying at that height would be the worst sort of danger. You leave it
to me, Mary. I won't take you up above the clouds on this sky ride;
though, later, I'm sure you'll want to try that.  This is only a little
flight. You've been promising long enough to take a trip with me, and
now I believe you're trying to back out."
</P>

<P>
"No, really I'm not, Tom! Only, at the last minute, the machine looks
so small and frail, and the sky is so&mdash;big&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
She glanced up and seemed to shiver just a trifle.
</P>

<P>
"Don't be thinking of those things, Mary!" laughed Tom Swift.  "Trot
along and get ready. The motor never worked better, and we may break a
few speed records this morning. No traffic cops to stop us, either, as
there might be if we were in an auto."
</P>

<P>
"There you go, Mary!" exclaimed Tom, as if struck with a new thought.
"You've ridden in an auto with me many a time, and you never were a bit
afraid, though we were in more danger than we'll be this morning."
</P>

<P>
"Danger, Tom, in an auto? How?"
</P>

<P>
"Why, danger of a wheel collapsing as we were going full speed; or the
steering knuckle breaking and sending us into a tree; danger of running
into a stone wall or a ditch; danger of some one running into us, or of
us running into some one else. There isn't one of these dangers on a
sky ride."
</P>

<P>
"No," said Mary slowly. "But there's the danger of falling."
</P>

<P>
"One against twenty. That's the safety margin. And, if we do fall, it
will be like landing in a feather bed! There, don't wait any longer. Go
and get ready."
</P>

<P>
Mary sighed, and then, seeming to summon her nerve to her aid, she
smiled brightly, waved her hand to Tom, and hastened toward his home,
where Mrs. Baggert the matronly housekeeper, was waiting to help the
girl attire herself in a flying-suit of leather.
</P>

<P>
Mary Nestor, who had a very warm place in the heart of Tom Swift, had,
as he stated, some time since promised to take a trip in the air with
the young inventor. But she had kept putting it off, for one reason or
another, until Tom began to despair of ever getting her to accompany
him. To-day, however, when she had called to inquire about his father,
who had been slightly ill, Tom had, after the social visit, insisted on
the promise being kept.
</P>

<P>
He had his mechanic get out one of the safest, though a speedy, double
machine, and, with Mary to watch, Tom had taken a trial flight, just to
show her how easy it was. It was not the first time she had seen him
take to the air, but now she watched with different emotions, for she
was vitally interested.
</P>

<P>
Tom had sailed down from aloft, making a landing in the aviation field
he had constructed near his home, and then he had insisted that Mary
should keep her promise to take a sky ride with him.
</P>

<P>
"Don't be too long now!" called Tom to the girl, as she hurried toward
the house. "Never mind about your hair, or whether your hat's on
straight. You're going to wear a cap, anyhow, and tuck your hair up
under that. It's hot down here, but it will be cold up above; so tell
Mrs. Baggert to see that you're warmly dressed."
</P>

<P>
"All right," and gaily she waved her hand to him. Now that she had made
her decision, and was really going up, she was not half so frightened
as she had been in the contemplation of it.
</P>

<P>
As Tom climbed out of the machine, to give it a careful inspection,
though he was certain there was nothing wrong, an aged colored man
shuffled toward him.
</P>

<P>
"Yo'&mdash;yo'll be mighty careful ob Miss Nestor now, won't yo', Massa
Tom?" asked the man.
</P>

<P>
"Of course I will, Eradicate," was the young inventor's answer.
</P>

<P>
"Case we ain't got many laik her no mo', an' dat's de truf, Massa Tom,"
went on the old man. "So be mighty careful laik!"
</P>

<P>
"That's what I will, Rad! And, while I'm up in the air, don't you and
Koku have any trouble."
</P>

<P>
"Ho! Trouble wif dat onery no-'count giant! I guess not!" and the
colored man limped off, highly indignant.
</P>

<P>
Satisfied, from an inspection of his machine, that it was as nearly
mechanically perfect as it was possible to be, Tom Swift finished his
trip around it and stood near the big propeller, waiting for Mary
Nestor to reappear. Presently she did so, and Tom gaily waved his hand
to her.
</P>

<P>
"You're a picture!" he cried, as he saw how particularly "fetching" she
looked in the aviator's costume which was like his own. Because of the
danger of entanglement, Miss Nestor had doffed her skirts, and wore the
costume of all aviators&mdash;men and women.
</P>

<P>
"I wish I had my camera!" cried Tom. "You look&mdash;stunning!"
</P>

<P>
"I hope that isn't any comment on how I'm going to feel if we have to
make a&mdash;forced landing, I believe you call it," she retorted.
</P>

<P>
"Oh, I'll take care of that!" exclaimed Tom. "Now up you go, and we'll
start," and he helped her to climb into the padded seat of the cockpit,
behind where he was to sit.
</P>

<P>
"Oh, Tom! Don't be in such a hurry!" expostulated Mary. "Let me get my
breath!"
</P>

<P>
"No!" laughed the young inventor. "If I did you might back out.  Get
in, fasten the strap around you and sit still. That's all you have to
do. Don't be afraid, I'll be very careful. And don't try to yell at me
to go slower or lower once we're up in the air.
</P>

<P>
"Why not?" Mary wanted to know, as she settled herself in her seat.
</P>

<P>
"Because I can't very well hear you, or talk to you. The motor makes so
much noise, you know. We can do a little talking through this speaking
tube," and he indicated one, "but it isn't very satisfactory. So if you
have anything to say&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
"In the language of the poets," interrupted Mary, "if I have words to
spill, prepare to spill them now. Well, I haven't! Now I'm here, go
ahead! I shall probably be too frightened to talk, anyhow."
</P>

<P>
"Oh, no you won't&mdash;after the first little sensation," Tom assured her.
"You'll be crazy about it.  Come on, Jackson!" he called to the
mechanician. "Start the ball rolling!"
</P>

<P>
Tom was in his place, his goggles and cap well down over his face, and
he was adjusting the switch as the mechanic prepared to spin the
propellers.
</P>

<P>
Suddenly a man came running from the Swift house, waving his arms not
unlike the blades of an aircraft propeller, he also shouted, but Tom,
whose ears were covered with his fur cap, could not hear. However,
Jackson did, and stopped whirling the blades, turning about to see what
was wanted.
</P>

<P>
"Why, it's Mr. Damon!" exclaimed Tom, as he caught sight of the excited
man. "Hello, what's the matter?" the youth asked, pulling aside one
flap of his head-covering so he might hear the answer.
</P>

<P>
"Tom! Wait a minute! Bless my mouse trap!" exclaimed Mr. Damon, "I want
to speak to you!" He was panting from his run across the field. "I just
got to your house&mdash;saw your father&mdash;he said you were going up with Miss
Nestor, but&mdash;bless my dog biscuit&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
"Can't stop now, Mr. Damon!" answered Tom, with a laugh. "I have only
just succeeded, by hard work, in getting Mary to a point where she has
consented to take a sky ride. If I stop now she'll back out and I'll
never get her in again. See you when I come back," and Tom pulled the
covering over his ear once more.
</P>

<P>
"But, Tom, bless my shoe laces! This is important!"
</P>

<P>
"So's this!" answered Tom, with a grin. He saw, by the motion of Mr.
Damon's lips, what the latter had said.
</P>

<P>
Around swung the propeller blades. The gasoline vapor in the cylinders
was being compressed.
</P>

<P>
"Contact!" called Tom sharply, as he pressed the switch to give the
igniting spark at the proper moment. The mechanic had stepped back out
of the way, in case there should be a premature starting of the
powerful engine, in which event the blades would have cut him to pieces.
</P>

<P>
"Wait, Tom! Wait! This is very important! Bless my collar button, Tom
Swift, but this is&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
Bang! Bang! Bang!
</P>

<P>
With a series of explosions, like those of a machine gun, the motor
started, and further talk was out of the question. Tom turned on more
gas. The propellers became almost invisible blades of light and shadow,
and the aeroplane began moving over the grassy field. The mechanic had
sprung out of the way, pulling Mr. Damon with him.
</P>

<P>
"Come back! Come back! Wait a minute, Tom Swift! Bless my pansy
blossoms, I want to tell you something!" cried the little man.
</P>

<P>
But Tom Swift was away and out of hearing. He had started on his sky
ride with Mary Nestor.
</P>

CHAPTER II
</H3>

<H3 ALIGN="center">
A NEW IDEA
</H3>

<P>
Any one who has taken a flight in an aeroplane or gone up in a balloon,
will know exactly how Mary Nestor felt on this, her first sky ride of
any distance. For a moment, as she looked over the side of the machine,
she had a distinct impression, not that she was going up, but that some
one had pulled the earth down from beneath her and, at the same time,
given her a shove off into space. Such is the first sensation of going
aloft. Then the rush of air all about her, the slightly swaying motion
of the craft, and the vibration caused by the motor took her attention.
But the sensation of the earth dropping away from beneath her remained
with Mary for some time.
</P>

<P>
This sensation is much greater in a balloon than in an aeroplane, for a
balloon, unless there is a strong wind blowing, goes straight up, while
an aeroplane ascends on a long slant, and always into the teeth of the
wind, to take advantage of its lifting power on the underside of the
planes. The reason for this sensation&mdash;that of the earth's dropping
down, instead of one's feeling, what really happens, that one is
ascending&mdash;is because there are no objects by which comparison can be
made. If one starts off on the earth's surface at slow, or at great
speed, one passes stationary objects&mdash;houses, posts, trees, and the
like&mdash;and judges the speed by the rapidity with which these are left
behind.
</P>

<P>
Going up is unlike this. There is nothing to pass. One simply cleaves
the air, and only as it rushes past can one be sure of movement. And as
the air is void of color and form, there is no sensation of passing
anything.
</P>

<P>
So Mary Nestor, as she shot into the air with Tom Swift, had a
sensation as though the earth were dropping from beneath her. For a
moment she felt as though she were in some vast void&mdash;floating in
space&mdash;and she had a great fear. Then she calmed herself. She looked at
Tom sitting in front of her. Of course, all she could see was his back,
but it looked to be a very sturdy back, indeed, and he sat there in the
aircraft as calmly as though in a chair on the ground. Then Mary took
courage, and ceased to grasp the sides of the cockpit with a grip that
stiffened all her muscles.  She was beginning to "find herself."
</P>

<P>
On and on, and up and up, went Mary and Tom, in this the girl's first
big sky ride. The earth below seemed farther and farther away. The
wide, green fields became little emerald squares, and the houses like
those in a toy Noah's ark.
</P>

<P>
Down below, Mr. Wakefield Damon, who had hurried over from his home in
Waterfield to see Tom Swift, gazed aloft at the fast disappearing
aeroplane and its passengers.
</P>

<P>
"Bless my coal bin!" cried the eccentric man, "but Tom is in a hurry
this morning. Too bad he couldn't have stopped and spoken to me. It
might have been greatly to his advantage. But I suppose I shall have to
wait."
</P>

<P>
"You want to see Master?" asked a voice behind Mr. Damon, and, turning,
he beheld a veritable giant.
</P>

<P>
"Yes, Koku, I did," Mr. Damon answered, and he did not appear at all
surprised at the sight of the towering form beside him. "I wanted to
see Tom most particularly. But I shall have to wait.  I'll go in and
talk to Mr. Swift."
</P>

<P>
"Yaas, an' I go talk to Radicate," said the giant. "Him diggin' up
ground where Master told me to make garden. Radicate not strong enough
for dat!"
</P>

<P>
"Huh! there's trouble as soon as those two get to disputing," mused Mr.
Damon, as he went toward the house.
</P>

<P>
Meanwhile, Mary was beginning to enjoy herself. The sensation of moving
rapidly through the air in a machine as skillfully guided as was the
one piloted by Tom Swift was delightful. Up and up they went, and then
suddenly Mary felt a lurch, and the plane, which was now about a
thousand feet high, seemed to slip to one side.
</P>

<P>
Mary screamed, and began reaching for the buckle of the safety belt
that fastened her to her seat. She saw that something unusual had
occurred, for Tom was working frantically at the mechanism in front of
him.
</P>

<P>
But, in spite of this, he seemed aware that Mary was in danger, not so
much, perhaps, from what might happen to the machine, as what she might
do in her terror.
</P>

<P>
"Oh! Oh!" cried the girl, and Tom heard her above the terrific noise of
the motor, for she was speaking with her lips close to the tube that
served as a sort of inter-communicating telephone for the craft. "Oh,
we are falling! I'm going to jump!"
</P>

<P>
"Sit still! Sit still for your life!" cried Tom Swift. "I'll save you
all right! Only sit still! Don't jump!"
</P>

<P>
Mary, her red cheeks white, sank back, and the young inventor redoubled
his efforts at the controls and other mechanisms.
</P>

<P>
And that Tom was perfectly qualified to make a safe landing, even with
engine trouble, Mary Nestor well knew. Those of you who have read the
previous books of this series know it also, but, for the benefit of my
new readers, I shall state that this was by no means Tom's first ride
in an aeroplane.
</P>

<P>
He had operated and built gasoline engines ever since he was about
sixteen years old. As related in the initial volume of this series,
entitled, "Tom Swift and His Motorcycle," he became possessed of this
machine after it had started to climb a tree with Mr. Damon on board.
After that experience the eccentric man&mdash;blessing everything he could
think of&mdash;had no liking for the speedy motorcycle and sold it to Tom at
a low price.
</P>

<P>
That was the beginning of a friendship between the two, and also
started Tom on his career as an inventor and a possessor of many
gasoline craft. For he was not content with merely riding the repaired
motorcycle. He made improvements on it.
</P>

<P>
Tom lived with his father in the town of Shopton, their home being
looked after, since the death of Mrs. Swift, by Mrs. Baggert. Mr.
Wakefield Damon lived in the neighboring town of Waterfield, and spent
much time at Tom's home, often going on trips with him in various
vehicles of the land, sea or air.
</P>

<P>
As related in the various volumes of this series, Tom was not content
to remain on earth. He built a speedy motor boat, and then secured an
airship, following that with a submarine. He also made an electric
runabout that was the speediest car on the road.  Sending wireless
messages, having thrilling experiences among the diamond makers,
journeying to the caves of ice, and making perilous trips in his sky
racer took up part of the young inventor's time.
</P>

<P>
With his electric rifle he did some wonderful shooting, and in the
"City of Gold" made some strange discoveries, part of the fortune he
secured enabling him to build his sky racer. It was in a land of giants
that Tom was made captive, but he succeeded in escaping, and brought
two giants, of whom Koku was one, away with him.
</P>

<P>
Following this achievement Tom invented a wizard camera and a great
searchlight, which, with his giant cannon, was purchased by the United
States Government. Work on his photo-telephone and his aerial warship,
the problem of digging a big tunnel, and then traveling to the land of
wonders, kept Tom Swift very busy, and he had just completed a
wonderful piece of work when the present story opens.
</P>

<P>
This last achievement was the perfecting of a machine to aid in the
great World War and you will find the details set down in the volume
which immediately precedes this. "Tom Swift and His War Tank," it is
called, and in that is related how he not only invented a marvelous
machine, but succeeded in keeping its secret from the plotters who
tried to take it from him. In this Tom was helped by the inspiration of
Mary Nestor, whom he hoped some day to marry, and by Ned Newton, a
chum, who, though no inventor himself, could admire one.
</P>

<P>
Ned and Tom had been chums a long while, but Ned inclined more to
financial and office matters than to machinery. At times he had managed
affairs for Tom, and helped him finance projects. Ned was now an
important bank official, and since the United States had entered the
war had had charge of some Red Cross work, as well as Liberty Bond
campaigns.
</P>

<P>
Somehow, as she sat there in the craft which seemed disabled, Mary
Nestor could not help thinking of Tom's many activities, in some of
which she had shared.
</P>

<P>
"Oh, if he falls now, and is killed!" she thought. "Oh, what will
happen to us?"
</P>

<P>
"It's all right, Mary! Don't worry! It's all right!" cried Tom, through
the speaking tube.
</P>

<P>
"What's that? I can't hear you very well!" she called back.
</P>

<P>
"No wonder, with the racket this motor is making," he answered.  "Why
can't something be done so you can talk in an aeroplane as well as in a
balloon? That's an idea! If I could tell you what was the matter now
you wouldn't be a bit frightened, for it isn't anything. But, as it
is&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
"What are you saying, Tom? I can't hear you!" cried Mary, still much
frightened.
</P>

<P>
"I say it's all right&mdash;don't get scared. And don't jump!" Tom shouted
until his ears buzzed. "It's all nonsense&mdash;having a motor making so
much noise one can't talk!" he went on, irritatedly.
</P>

<P>
A strange idea had come to the young inventor, but there was no time to
think of it now. Mentally he registered a vow to take up this idea and
work on it as soon as possible. But, just now, the aeroplane needed all
his attention.
</P>

<P>
As he had told Mary, there was really nothing approaching any great
danger. But it was rather an anxious moment. If Tom had been alone he
would have thought little of it, but with Mary along he felt a double
responsibility.
</P>

<P>
What had happened was that the craft had suddenly gone into an "air
pocket" or partial vacuum, and there had been a sudden fall and a slide
slip. In trying to stop this too quickly Tom had broken one of his
controls, and he was busily engaged in putting an auxiliary one in
place and trying to reassure Mary at the same time.
</P>

<P>
"But it's mighty hard trying to do that through a speaking tube with a
motor making a noise like a boiler factory," mused the young inventor.
Tom worked quickly and to good purpose. In a few moments, though to
Mary they seemed like hours, the machine was again gliding along on a
level keel, and Tom breathed more easily.
</P>

<P>
"And now for my great idea!" he told himself.
</P>

<P>
But it was some time before he could give his attention to that.

CHAPTER III
</H3>

<H3 ALIGN="center">
THE BIG OFFER
</H3>

<P>
Working with all the skill he possessed, Tom had got the aeroplane in
proper working order again. As has been said, the accident was a
trivial one, and had he been alone, or with an experienced aviator, he
would have thought little of it. Then, very likely, he would have
volplaned to earth and made the repairs there. But he did not want to
frighten Mary Nestor, so he fixed the control while gliding along, and
made light of it. Thus his passenger was reassured.
</P>

<P>
"Are we all right?" asked Mary through the tube, as they sailed along.
</P>

<P>
"Right as a fiddle," answered Tom, shouting through the same means of
communication.
</P>

<P>
"What's that about a riddle?" asked Mary, in surprise at his seeming
flippancy at such a time.
</P>

<P>
"I didn't say anything about a riddle&mdash;I said we are as fit as a
fiddle!" cried Tom. "Never mind. No use trying to talk with the racket
this motor makes, and it isn't the noisiest of its kind, either. I'll
tell you when we get down. Do you like it?"
</P>

<P>
"Yes, I like it better than I did at first," answered Mary, for she had
managed to understand the last of Tom's questions. Then he sailed a
little higher, circled about, and, a little later, not to get Mary too
tired and anxious, he headed for his landing field.
</P>

<P>
"I'll take you home in the auto," he cried to his passenger.  "We could
go up to your house this way&mdash;in style&mdash;if there was a field near by
large enough to land in. But there isn't. So it will have to be a
plain, every-day auto."
</P>

<P>
"That's good enough for me," said Mary. "Though this trip is
wonderful&mdash;glorious! I'll go again any time you ask me."
</P>

<P>
"Well, I'll ask you," said Tom. "And when I do maybe it won't be so
hard to hold a conversation. It will be more like this," and he shut
off the motor and began to glide gently down. The quiet succeeding the
terrific noise of the motor exhaust was almost startling, and Tom and
Mary could converse easily without using the tube.
</P>

<P>
Then followed the landing on the soft, springy turf, a little glide
over the ground, and the machine came to a halt, while mechanics ran
out of the hangar to take charge of it.
</P>

<P>
"I'll just go in and change these togs," said Mary, as she alighted and
looked at her leather costume.
</P>

<P>
"No, don't," advised Tom. "You look swell in em. Keep 'em on.  They're
yours, and you'll need 'em when we go up again. Here comes the auto.
I'll take you right home in it. Keep the aviation suit on.
</P>

<P>
"I wonder what Mr. Damon could have wanted," remarked Tom, as he drove
Mary along the country road.
</P>

<P>
"He seemed very much excited," she replied.
</P>

<P>
"Oh, he almost always is that way&mdash;blessing everything he can think of.
You know that. But this time it was different, I'll admit. I hope
nothing is the matter. I might have stopped and spoken to him, but I
was afraid if I did you'd back out and wouldn't come for a sky ride."
</P>

<P>
"Well, I might have. But now that I've had one, even with an accident
thrown in, I'll go any time you ask me, Tom," and Mary smiled at the
young inventor.
</P>

<P>
"Shucks, that wasn't a real accident!" he laughed. "But I do wonder
what Mr. Damon wanted."
</P>

<P>
"Better go back and find out, Tom," advised Mary, as they stopped in
front of her house.
</P>

<P>
"Oh, I want to come in and talk to you. Haven't had a chance for a good
talk today, that motor made such a racket."
</P>

<P>
"No, go along now, but come back and see me this afternoon if you like."
</P>

<P>
"I do like, all right! And I suppose Mr. Damon will be fussing until he
sees me. Well, glad you liked your first ride in the air, Mary&mdash;that
is, the first one of any account," for Mary had been in an aeroplane
before, though only up a little way&mdash;a sort of "grass-cutting stunt,"
Tom called it.
</P>

<P>
Waving farewell to the pretty girl, the young aviator turned the auto
about and speeded for his home and the shops adjoining it. His father
had not been well, of late, and Tom was a bit anxious about him.
</P>

<P>
"Mr. Damon may bother him, though he wouldn't mean to," thought Tom.
"He seemed to have his mind filled with some new idea. I wonder if it
is anything like mine? No, it couldn't be. Well, I'll soon find out,"
and, putting his foot on the accelerator, Tom sent the machine along at
a pace that soon brought him within sight of his home.
</P>

<P>
"Is father all right?" he asked Mrs. Baggert, who was out on the front
porch, as though waiting for him.
</P>

<P>
"Oh, yes, Tom, he's all right," the housekeeper answered.
</P>

<P>
"Is Mr. Damon with him?"
</P>

<P>
"No."
</P>

<P>
"He hasn't gone home, has he?"
</P>

<P>
"No, he's around somewhere. But some one else is with your father. Some
visitors."
</P>

<P>
"Any relations?"
</P>

<P>
"No; strangers. They came to see you, and they're rather impatient. I
came out to see if you were in sight. Your father sent me."
</P>

<P>
"Are they bothering him&mdash;talking business that I ought to attend to
when he's ill? That mustn't be."
</P>

<P>
"Well, I suppose it is business that the strangers are talking over
with your father, Tom," said Mrs. Baggert, "for I heard sums of money
spoken of. But your father seems to be all right, only a trifle anxious
that you should come."
</P>

<P>
"Well, I'm here now and I'll attend to things. Where are the strangers,
and who are they?"
</P>

<P>
"I don't know," answered the housekeeper. "I never saw them before, but
they're in the library with your father. Do you think they'll stay to
dinner? If you do, I'll have Eradicate or Koku catch and kill a
chicken."
</P>

<P>
"If you let one do it don't tell the other about it," said Tom with a
laugh, "or you'll have a chicken race around the yard that will make
the visitors sit up and take notice."
</P>

<P>
There was great rivalry between Eradicate Sampson, the aged colored
man, and Koku, the giant, and they were continually disputing. Each one
loved and served Tom in his own way, and there was jealousy between
them. Koku, the giant Tom had brought with him from the land where the
young inventor had been made captive, was a big, powerful man, and
could do things the aged colored servant could not attempt. But "Rad,"
as he was often called, and his mule "Boomerang" had long been fixtures
on the Swift homestead. But old age crept on apace with Eradicate,
though he hated to admit it, and Koku did many things the colored man
had formerly attended to, and Rad was always on the lookout not to be
supplanted. Hence Tom's warning to Mrs. Baggert about letting the two
be entrusted with the same mission of catching a chicken for the pot.
</P>

<P>
"Better get the fowl yourself and say nothing to either of them about
it," Tom advised the housekeeper. "Mr. Damon will stay to dinner, as he
always does when he comes, and as it's near twelve now, and as I may be
delayed talking business to these strangers, you'd better get up a
bigger meal than usual."
</P>

<P>
"I will, Tom," promised Mrs. Baggert. And then the young inventor,
having seen that one of the men took the automobile to the garage, went
into the house.
</P>

<P>
"Oh, here you are!" was his father's greeting, as he came out into the
hall from the library. "I've been waiting anxiously for you, my boy. I
couldn't think what was keeping you."
</P>

<P>
"Oh, I had a little trouble with the air machine&mdash;nothing serious."
</P>

<P>
A moment later Tom was standing before two well-dressed,
prosperous-looking business men, who smiled pleasantly at him.
</P>

<P>
"Mr. Thomas Swift?" interrogated one, the elder, as he held out his
hand.
</P>

<P>
"That's my name," answered Tom, pleasantly.
</P>

<P>
"I'm Peton Gale, and this gentleman is Boland Ware," went on the man
who had taken Tom's hand. "I'm president and he's treasurer of the
Universal Flying Machine Company, of New York."
</P>

<P>
"Oh, yes," said Tom, as he shook hands with Mr. Ware. "I have heard of
your concern. You are doing a lot of government work, are you not?"
</P>

<P>
"Yes; war orders. And we're up to our neck in them. This war is going
to be almost as much fought in the air as on the ground, Mr. Swift."
</P>

<P>
"I can well believe that," agreed Tom. "Won't you have a chair?"
</P>

<P>
"Well, we didn't come to stay long," said Mr. Gale with a laugh, which,
somehow or other, grated on Tom and seemed to him insincere. "Our
business is such a rushing one that we don't spend much time anywhere.
To get down to brass tacks, we have come to see you to put a certain
proposition before you, Mr. Swift. You are open to a business
proposition, aren't you?"
</P>

<P>
"Oh, yes," answered Tom. "That's what I'm here for."
</P>

<P>
"I thought so. Well, now I'll tell you, in brief, what we want, and
then Mr. Ware, our treasurer, can elaborate on it, and give you facts
and figures about which I never bother myself. I attend to the
executive end and leave the details to others," and again came that
laugh which Tom did not like.
</P>

<P>
"You came here to make me an offer?" asked the young inventor,
wondering to which of his many machines the visitors had reference.
</P>

<P>
"Yes," went on Mr. Gale, "we came here to make you a big offer.  In
short, Mr. Swift, we want you to work for our company, and we are
willing to pay you ten thousand dollars a year for the benefit of your
advice and your inventive abilities. Ten thousand dollars a year! Do
you accept?"
</P>

CHAPTER IV
</H3>

<H3 ALIGN="center">
MR. DAMON'S WHIZZER
</H3>

<P>
Characteristic it was of Tom Swift that he did not seem at all
surprised at what most young men would call a liberal offer.  Certainly
not many youths of Tom's age would be sought out by a big manufacturing
concern, and offered ten thousand dollars a year "right off the reel,"
as Ned Newton expressed it later. But Tom only smiled and shook his
head in negation.
</P>

<P>
"What!" cried Mr. Gale, "you mean you won't accept our offer?"
</P>

<P>
"I can't," answered Tom.
</P>

<P>
"You can't!" exclaimed the treasurer, Mr. Ware. "Oh, I see. Mr. Gale, a
word with you. Excuse us a moment," he added to Tom and his father.
</P>

<P>
The two men consulted in a corner of the library for a moment, and
then, with smiles on their faces, once more turned toward the young
inventor.
</P>

<P>
"Well, perhaps you are right, Tom Swift," said Mr. Gale. "Of course, we
recognize your talents and ability, but you cannot blame us for trying
to get talent, as well as material for our airships, in the cheapest
market. But we are not hide-bound, nor sticklers for any set sum. We'll
make that offer fifteen thousand dollars a year, if you will sign a
five-year contract and agree that we shall have first claim on anything
and everything you may patent or invent in that time. Now, how does
that strike you?  Fifteen thousand dollars a year&mdash;paid weekly if you
wish, and our Mr. Ware, here, has a form of contract which can be fixed
up and signed within ten minutes, if you agree."
</P>

<P>
"Well, I don't like to be disagreeable," said Tom with a smile; "but,
really, as I said before, I can't accept your very kind offer. I may
say liberal offer. I appreciate that."
</P>

<P>
"You can't accept!" cried Mr. Gale.
</P>

<P>
"Are you sure you don't mean 'won't'?" asked Mr. Ware, in a half growl.
</P>

<P>
"You may call it that if you like," replied Tom, a bit coolly, for he
did not like the other's tone, "Only, as I say, I cannot accept. I have
other plans."
</P>

<P>
"Oh, you&mdash;" began the brusk treasurer, but Mr. Gale, the president of
the Universal Flying Machine Company, stopped his associate with a
warning look.
</P>

<P>
"Just a moment, Mr. Swift," begged the president. "Don't be hasty. We
are prepared to make you a last and final offer, and I do not believe
you can refuse it."
</P>

<P>
"Well, I certainly will not refuse it without hearing it," said Tom,
with a smile he meant to make good-natured. Yet, truth to tell, he did
not at all like the two visitors. There was something about them that
aroused his antagonism, and he said later that even if they had offered
him a sum which he felt he ought not, in justice to himself and his
father, refuse, he would have felt a distaste in working for a company
represented by the twain.
</P>

<P>
"This is our offer," said Mr. Gale, and he spoke in a pompous manner
which seemed to say: "If you don't take it, why, it will be the worse
for you." He looked at his treasurer for a confirmatory nod and,
receiving it, went on. "We are prepared to offer and pay you, and will
enter into such a contract, with the stipulation about the inventions
that I mentioned before&mdash;we are prepared to pay you&mdash;twenty thousand
dollars a year! Now what do you say to that, Tom Swift?
</P>

<P>
"Twenty-thousand-dollars-a-year!" repeated Mr. Gale unctuously, rolling
the words off his tongue. "Twen-ty-thou-sand-dol-lars-a-year!  Think of
it!"
</P>

<P>
"I am thinking of it," said Tom Swift gently, "and I thank you for your
offer. It is, indeed, very generous. But I must give you the same
answer. I cannot accept."
</P>

<P>
"Tom!" exclaimed his aged father.
</P>

<P>
"Mr. Swift!" exclaimed the two visitors.
</P>

<P>
Tom smiled and shook his head.
</P>

<P>
"Oh, I know very well what I am saying, and what I am turning down," he
said. "But I simply cannot accept. I have other plans.  I am sorry you
have had your trip for nothing," he added to the visitors, "but,
really, I must refuse."
</P>

<P>
"Is that your final answer?" asked Mr. Gale.
</P>

<P>
"Yes."
</P>

<P>
"Don't you want to take a day or two to think it over?" asked the
treasurer. "Don't be hasty. Remember that very few young men can
command that salary, and I may say you will find us liberal in other
ways. You would have some time to yourself."
</P>

<P>
"That is what I most need," returned Tom. "Time to myself. No, thank
you, gentlemen, I cannot accept."
</P>

<P>
"Be careful!" warned Mr. Gale, and it sounded as though there might be
a threat in his voice. "This is our last offer, and your last chance.
We will not renew this. If you do not accept our twenty thousand
dollars now, you will never get it again."
</P>

<P>
"I realize that," said Tom, "and I am prepared to take the consequences.
</P>

<P>
"Very well, then," said Mr. Gale. "There seems nothing for us to do,
Mr. Ware, but to go back to New York. I bid you good-day," and he bowed
stiffly to Tom. "I hope you will not regret your refusal of our offer."
</P>

<P>
"I hope so myself," said Tom, lightly.
</P>

<P>
When the visitors had gone Mr. Swift turned toward his son, and,
shaking his head, remarked:
</P>

<P>
"Of course, you know your own business best, Tom. Yet I cannot but feel
you have made a mistake."
</P>

<P>
"How?" asked Tom. "By not taking that money? I can easily make that in
a year, with an idea I have in mind for an improvement on an airship.
And your new electric motor will soon be ready for the market. Besides,
we don't really need the money."
</P>

<P>
"No, not now, Tom, but there is no telling when we may," said Mr.
Swift, slowly. "This big war has made many changes, and things that
brought us in a good income before, hardly sell at all, now."
</P>

<P>
"Oh, don't worry, Dad! We still have a few shots left in the locker&mdash;in
other words, the bank. I'm expecting Ned Newton over any moment now, to
give us the annual statement of our account, and then we'll know where
we stand. I'm not afraid from the money end. Our business has done
well, and it is going to do better. I have a new idea."
</P>

<P>
"That's all very well, Tom," said Mr. Swift, who seemed oppressed by
something. "As you say, money isn't everything, and I know we shall
always have enough to live on. But there is something about those two
men I do not like. They were very angry at your refusal of their offer.
I could see that. Tom, I don't want to be a croaker, but I think you'll
have to watch out for those men. They're going to be your enemies&mdash;your
rivals in the airship field," and Mr. Swift shook his head dolefully.
</P>

<P>
"Well, rivalry, when it's clean and above board, is the spice of trade
and invention," returned Tom, lightly. "I'm not afraid of that."
</P>

<P>
"No, but it may be unfair and underhand," said Mr. Swift. "I think it
would have been better, Tom, to have accepted their offer. Twenty
thousand a year, clear money, is a good sum."
</P>

<P>
"Yes, but I may make twice that with something that occurred to me only
a little while ago. Forget about those men, Dad, and I'll tell you my
new idea. But wait, I want Mr. Damon to hear it, too.  Where is he?"
</P>

<P>
"He was here a little while ago. He went out when those two men came
and&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
At that moment, from the garden at the side of the library, the sound
of voices in dispute could be heard.
</P>

<P>
"Now yo' all g'wan 'way from yeah!" exclaimed some one who could be
none other than Eradicate Sampson. "Whut fo' yo' all want to clutter up
dish yeah place fo'? Massa Tom said I was to do de garden wuk, an' I'se
gwine to do it! G'wan 'way, Giant!"
</P>

<P>
"Ho! You want me to get out, s'pose you put me, black face!" cried a
big voice, that of Koku, the giant.
</P>

<P>
"There they go! At it again!" cried Tom with a smile. "Might have known
if I told Rad to do anything that Koku would be jealous. Well, I'll
have to go out now and give that giant something to do that will tax
his strength."
</P>

<P>
But as Tom was about to leave the room another voice was heard in the
garden.
</P>

<P>
"Now, boys, be nice," said some one soothingly. "The garden is large
enough for you both to work in. Rad, you begin at the lower end and
spade toward the middle. Koku, you begin at the upper end and work
down. Whoever gets to the middle first will win."
</P>

<P>
"Ha! Den I'll show dat giant some spade wuk as is spade wuk!" cried the
colored man. "Garden wuk is mah middle name."
</P>

<P>
"Be careful, Rad!" laughed Mr. Damon, for he it was who was trying to
act as peacemaker. "Remember that Koku is very strong."
</P>

<P>
"Yas, sah! He may be strong, but he's clumsy!" chuckled Eradicate. "You
watch me beat him!"
</P>

<P>
"Ho! Black man get stuck in mud!" challenged Koku. "I show him!"
</P>

<P>
Then there was silence, and Tom and his father, looking out, saw the
two disputants beginning to spade the soil while Mr. Damon, satisfied
that he had, for the time being, stopped a quarrel, turned toward the
house.
</P>

<P>
"I was just coming to look for you," said Tom. "Sorry I had to go off
in such a hurry and leave you, but I had promised to take Mary for a
ride, and as it was her first one, for a distance, I didn't want her to
back out."
</P>

<P>
"That's all right, Tom, that's all right!" said Mr. Damon genially.
"Ladies first every time. But I do want to see you, and it's about
something important."
</P>

<P>
"No trouble, I hope?" queried Tom, for the manner of the eccentric man
was rather grave.
</P>

<P>
"Trouble? Oh, no! Bless my frying pan, no trouble, Tom! In fact, it may
be the other way about. Tom, I have an idea, and there may be millions
in it! That's it&mdash;millions!"
</P>

<P>
"Good!" cried the young inventor. "Might as well bite off a big lump
while you're at it. So you have a new idea! Well, I have myself, but
I'll listen to yours first. What is it, Mr. Damon?"
</P>

<P>
"It's a new kind of airship, Tom. I haven't got it all worked out yet,
but I can give you a rough outline. On my way over I got to thinking
about balloons, aeroplanes and the like, and it occurred to me that the
present principles are all wrong."
</P>

<P>
"So I evolved a new type of machine. I'm going to call it the Damon
Whizzer. Maybe Demon Whizzer would be more appropriate, but we won't
decide on that now. Anyhow, it's going to be a whizzer, and I want to
talk to you about it. There is an entirely new principle of elevation
and propulsion involved in my Whizzer, and I&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
At that moment there came a crash and clatter of steel and wood from
the garden, out of sight of which Tom and Mr. Damon had walked while
talking. Then followed a jangle of words.
</P>

<P>
"They're at it again!" cried Tom, as he ran toward the side of the
house. "I guess it's a fight this time!"

CHAPTER V
</H3>

<H3 ALIGN="center">
TOM'S PROJECT
</H3>

<P>
Curious was the sight that met the gaze of Tom Swift and Mr. Wakefield
Damon as they rounded the corner of the house and looked into the newly
spaded garden. There stood the giant, Koku, holding aloft in the air,
by one hand, the form of the struggling colored man, Eradicate Sampson.
And Eradicate was vainly trying to get at his enemy and rival, but was
prevented by the long-distance hold the giant had on him.
</P>

<P>
"Yo' let me go, now! Yo' let me go, big man," cried Eradicate.  "Ef yo'
don't I'll bust yo' wide open, dat's whut I'll do! An' 'sides, I'll
tell Massa Tom on yo', dat's whut I'll do!"
</P>

<P>
"Ho! You tell&mdash;I let you fall!" threatened Koku.
</P>

<P>
His threat was dire enough, for such was his size and strength that he
held the colored man nearly nine feet from the ground, and a fall from
that distance would seriously jar Eradicate, if it did nothing else.
The colored man's eyes opened wide as he heard what Koku said, and then
he cried:
</P>

<P>
"Let me down! Let me down, an' I won't say nuffin!"
</P>

<P>
"An' you let me scatter dirt?" asked Koku, for such was the giant's
idea of working in the garden.
</P>

<P>
"Yes, yo' kin scatter de dirt seben ways from Sunday fo' all I keers!"
conceded Eradicate. Then, as he was lowered to the ground, he and the
giant turned and saw Mr. Damon and Tom approaching.
</P>

<P>
"What's wrong?" asked the young inventor.
</P>

<P>
"'Scuse me, Massa Tom," began Eradicate, "but didn't yo' tell me to
spade de garden?"
</P>

<P>
"I guess I did," admitted Tom Swift.
</P>

<P>
"An' you tell me help&mdash;yes?" questioned Koku.
</P>

<P>
"Well, I thought it would be a little too much for you, Rad," said Tom,
gently. "I thought perhaps you'd like help."
</P>

<P>
"Hu! Not him, anyhow!" declared the colored man in great disgust. "When
I git so old dat I cain't spade a garden, den me an' Boomerang, we-all
gwine to die, dat's all I got to say. I was a-spadin' my part ob de
garden, Massa Tom, same laik Mr. Damon done tole me to, an' dish yeah
big mess ob bones steps on my side ob de middle an&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
"Him too slow. Koku scatter dirt twice times so fast!" declared the
giant, whose English was not much better than Eradicate's.
</P>

<P>
"Yes, I see," said Tom. "You are so strong, Koku, that you finished
your part before Eradicate did. Well, it was good of you to want to
help him."
</P>

<P>
At this the giant grinned at his rival.
</P>

<P>
"At the same time," went on Tom, winking an eye at Mr. Damon,
"Eradicate knows a little more about garden work, on account of having
done it so many years."
</P>

<P>
"Ha! Whut I tell yo', Giant!" boasted the colored man. It was his turn
to smile.
</P>

<P>
"And so," went on Tom, judicially, "I guess I'll let Rad finish spading
the garden, and you, Koku, can come and help me lift some heavy engine
parts. Mr. Damon wants to explain something to me."
</P>

<P>
"Ha! Nothing what so heavy Koku not lift!" boasted the giant.
</P>

<P>
"Go on! Lift yo'se'f 'way from heah!" muttered Eradicate as he picked
up his dropped spade. And then, with a smile of satisfaction, he fell
to work in the mellow soil while Tom led Koku to one of the shops where
he set him to lifting heavy motor parts about in order to get at a
certain machine that was stored away in the back of one of the rooms.
</P>

<P>
"That will keep him busy," said the young inventor. "And now, Mr.
Damon, I can listen to you. Do you really think you have a new idea in
airships?"
</P>

<P>
"I really think so, Tom. My Whizzer is bound to revolutionize travel in
the air. Let me tell you what I mean. Now cast your mind back. How many
ways are now used to propel an airship or a dirigible balloon through
the air? How many ways?"
</P>

<P>
"Two, as far as I know," said Tom. "At least there are only two that
have proved to be practical."
</P>

<P>
"Exactly," said Mr. Damon. "One with the propeller, or propellers, in
front, and that is the tractor type. The other has the propeller in the
rear, and that is the pusher type. Both good as far as they go, but I
have something better."
</P>

<P>
"What?" asked Tom with a smile.
</P>

<P>
"It's a Whizzer," said the eccentric man. "Bless my gold tooth!  but
that is the best name I can think of for it. And, really, the propeller
I'm thinking of inventing does whiz around."
</P>

<P>
"But are you going to use a tractor or pusher type?" Tom wanted to know.
</P>

<P>
"It's a combination of both," answered Mr. Damon. "As it is now, Tom,
you have to get an aeroplane in pretty speedy motion before it will
rise from the ground, don't you?"
</P>

<P>
"Yes, of course. That's the principle on which an aeroplane rises and
keeps aloft, by its speed in the air. As soon as that speed stops it
begins to fall, or volplane, as we call it."
</P>

<P>
"Exactly. Now, instead of having to depend on the speed of the
aeroplane for this, why not depend on the speed of the propeller&mdash;in
other words, the whizzer?"
</P>

<P>
"Well, we do," said Tom, a bit puzzled as to what his friend was trying
to get at. "If the propeller didn't move the airship wouldn't
rise&mdash;that is, unless it's of the balloon type."
</P>

<P>
"What I mean," said Mr. Damon, "is to have an aeroplane that will move
in the air the same as a boat moves in the water. You don't have to get
the propeller of a boat racing around at the rate of a million
revolutions a minute, more or less, before your boat will travel, do
you? If the engine turns the screw, or propeller, just over say fifty
times a minute you would get some motion of the boat, wouldn't you?"
</P>

<P>
"Why, yes, some," admitted Tom.
</P>

<P>
"And what causes it?" asked Mr. Damon, anticipating a triumph.
</P>

<P>
"The resistance of the water to the blades of the screw, or propeller,"
answered Tom.
</P>

<P>
"Exactly! And it's the resistance of the air to the blades of an
airship propeller that sends the craft along, isn't it?"
</P>

<P>
"Yes. And because of the difference in density between air and water it
becomes necessary to revolve an aeroplane propeller many times faster
than a boat propeller. It's the density that makes the difference, Mr.
Damon. If air were as dense as water we could have comparatively
slow-moving motors and propellers and&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
"Ha! There you have it, Tom! And there is where my Whizzer&mdash;Wakefield
Damon's Whizzer&mdash;is going to revolutionize air travel!" cried the
eccentric man. "The difference in density! If air were as dense as
water the problem would be solved. And I have solved it! I'm going to
turn the trick, Tom! One more question. How can air be made as dense as
water, Tom Swift?"
</P>

<P>
"Why, by condensation or compression, I suppose," was the rather slow
answer. "You know they have condensed, or compressed, air until it is
liquid. I've done it myself, as an experiment."
</P>

<P>
"That's it, Tom! That's it!" cried Mr. Damon in delight.  "Compressed
air will do the trick! Not compressed to a liquid, exactly, but almost
so. I'm going to revolve the propellers of my new airship in compressed
air, so dense that they will not have to have a speed of more than
seven hundred revolutions a minute.  What's that compared to the three
to ten thousand revolutions of the propellers now used? The propellers
of Damon's Whizzer will be of the pusher type, and will revolve in
dense, compressed air, almost like water, and that will do away with
high speed motors, with all their complications, and make traveling in
the clouds as simple as taking out a little one-cylinder motor boat.
How's that, Tom Swift? How's that for an idea?"
</P>

<P>
To Mr. Damon's disappointment, Tom was not enthusiastic. The young
inventor gazed at his eccentric friend, and then said slowly:
</P>

<P>
"Well, that's all right in theory, but how is it going to work out in
practice?"
</P>

<P>
"That's what I came to see you about, Tom," was the reply.  "Bless my
tall hat! but that's just why I hurried over here. I wanted to tell you
when I saw you going off on a trip with Miss Nestor. That's my big
idea&mdash;Damon's Whizzer&mdash;propellers revolving in compressed air like
water. Isn't that great?"
</P>

<P>
"I'm sorry to shatter your air castle," said Tom; "but for the life of
me I can't see how it will work. Of course, in theory, if you could
revolve a big-bladed propeller in very dense, or in liquid, air, there
would be more resistance than in the rarefied atmosphere of the upper
regions. And, if this could be done, I grant you that you could use
slower motors and smaller propeller blades&mdash;more like those of a motor
boat. But how are you going to get the condensed air?"
</P>

<P>
"Make it!" said Mr. Damon promptly. "Air pumps are cheap. Just carry
one or two on board the aeroplane, and condense the air as you go
along. That's a small detail that can easily be worked out. I leave
that to you."
</P>

<P>
"I'd rather you wouldn't," said Tom. "That's the whole
difficulty&mdash;compressing your air. Wait! I'll explain it to you."
</P>

<P>
Then the young inventor went into details. He told of the ponderous
machinery needed to condense air to a form approximating water, and
spoke of the terrible pressure exerted by the liquid atmosphere.
</P>

<P>
"Anything that you would gain by having a slow-speed motor and smaller
propeller blades, would be lost by the ponderous air-condensing
machinery you would need," Tom told Mr. Damon.  "Besides, if you could
surround your propellers with a strata of condensed air, it would
create such terrible cold as to freeze the propeller blades and make
them as brittle as glass.
</P>

<P>
"Why, I have taken a heavy piece of metal, dipped it into liquid air,
and I could shatter the steel with a hammer as easily as a sheet of
ice. The cold of liquid air is beyond belief.
</P>

<P>
"Attempts have been made to make motors run with liquid air, but they
have not succeeded. To condense air and to carry it about so that
propellers might revolve in it, would be out of the question."
</P>

<P>
"You think so, Tom?" asked Mr. Damon.
</P>

<P>
"I'm sure of it!"
</P>

<P>
"Oh, dear! That's too bad. Bless my overshoes, but I thought I had a
new idea. Well, you ought to know. So Damon's Whizzer goes on the scrap
heap before ever it's built. Well, we'll say no more about it. You
ought to know best, Tom. I wasn't thinking of it so much for myself as
for you. I thought you'd like some new idea to work on."
</P>

<P>
"Much obliged, Mr. Damon, but I have a new idea," said Tom.
</P>

<P>
"You have? What is it? Tell me&mdash;that is, if it isn't a secret," went on
the eccentric man, as much delighted over Tom's new plan as he had been
over his own Whizzer, doomed to failure so soon.
</P>

<P>
"It isn't a secret from you," said Tom. "I got the idea while I was
riding with Mary. I wanted to talk to her&mdash;to tell her not to jump out
when we had a little accident&mdash;but I had trouble making myself
understood because of the noise of the motor."
</P>

<P>
"They do make a great racket," conceded Mr. Damon. "But I don't suppose
anything can be done about it."
</P>

<P>
"I don't see why there can't!" exclaimed Tom. "And that's my new
idea&mdash;to make a silent aircraft motor&mdash;perhaps silent propeller blades,
though it's the motor that makes the most noise. And that's what I'm
going to do&mdash;invent a silent aeroplane. Not because I want so much to
talk when I take passengers up in the air, but I believe such a motor
would be valuable, especially for scouting planes in war work. To go
over the enemy's lines and not be heard would be valuable many times.
</P>

<P>
"And that's what I'm going to do&mdash;work on a silent motor for Uncle Sam.
I've got the germ of an idea and now&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
"Excuse me," said a voice behind Mr. Damon and Tom, and, turning, the
young inventor beheld the form of Mr. Peton Gale, president of the
Universal Flying Machine Company.

<H3 ALIGN="center">
MAKING PLANS
</H3>

<P>
Tom Swift had drawn pencil and paper from his pocket, and, as he and
Mr. Damon were sitting on the steps of one of the shops, the young
inventor was about to demonstrate by a drawing part of his new project,
when the interruption came in the shape of one of the men who had, an
hour before, made a business offer to Tom.
</P>

<P>
"Excuse me," went on Mr. Peton Gale, "but Mr. Ware and I got to talking
it over on our way to the station&mdash;the matter of having you in our
company, Mr. Swift&mdash;and we concluded that it was worth twenty-five
thousand dollars a year for us to have you. So I came back&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
"It isn't of the slightest use, Mr. Gale, I assure you," said Tom, a
bit heatedly, for he did not like the persistency of this man, nor did
he like his coming on the factory grounds unannounced and in this
secret manner. "I told you I could not accept your offer. It is not
altogether a matter of money. My word was final."
</P>

<P>
"Oh very well, if you put it that way," said Mr. Gale stiffly, "of
course there is nothing more to say. But I thought perhaps you did not
consider we had offered you enough and&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
"Your offer is fair enough from a financial standpoint," said Tom; "but
I simply cannot accept it. I have other plans.  Jackson!" he called to
one of his mechanics who was passing, "kindly see Mr. Gale to the gate,
and then let me know how it was any one came in here without a permit."
</P>

<P>
"Yes, sir," said the mechanic, as he stood significantly waiting.
</P>

<P>
"There was no one at the gate when I came in," said Mr. Gale, and his
manner was antagonizing. "I wanted to speak to you&mdash;to ask you to
reconsider your offer&mdash;so I came back."
</P>

<P>
"It is against the rules to admit strangers to the shop grounds," said
Tom. "Good-day!"
</P>

<P>
The president of the Universal Flying Machine Company did not respond,
but there was a look on his face as he turned away that, had Tom seen
it, might have caused him some uneasiness. But he did not see. Instead,
he resumed his talk with Mr. Damon.
</P>

<P>
"Tom, your idea is most interesting," declared the eccentric man. "I
hope you will be able to work it out!"
</P>

<P>
"I'm going to try," said the young inventor. "I hope that man&mdash;Mr.
Gale&mdash;didn't hear anything of what I was saying. He sneaked up on us
before I was aware any one was near but ourselves."
</P>

<P>
"I don't imagine he heard very much, Tom," said Mr. Damon. "He may have
heard you mention a silent motor&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
"That's just what I wish he hadn't heard," broke in Tom.  "That's the
germ of the idea, and once it becomes known that I am working on that&mdash;
Well, there's no use crying over spilled milk," and he smiled at the
homely proverb. "I'll have to work in secret, once I've started."
</P>

<P>
"Do you think the government would use it, Tom?" asked his friend.
</P>

<P>
"I should think it would be glad to. Consider what a wonderful part
airships are playing in the present war. It really is a struggle to see
which will be the master of the sky&mdash;the Allies or the Germans&mdash;and, up
to recently, the Huns had the advantage.  Then the Allies, recognizing
how vital it was, began to forge ahead, and now Uncle Sam with his
troops under General Pershing is leading everything, or will lead
shortly. We have been a bit slow with our aircraft production, but now
we are booming along.  Uncle Sam will soon have the mastery of the sky."
</P>

<P>
"I hope so," sighed Mr. Damon. "We must beat the Germans!"
</P>

<P>
Briefly, Tom spoke of what Pershing's men were doing with their
aeroplanes in France, and mention was made of what the French and
British had done prior to the entrance of the United States into the
World War.
</P>

<P>
"While we were yet neutral, Americans had made gallant names for
themselves flying for France, and with my silent motor they ought to do
better," declared Tom.
</P>

<P>
"Is silence its chief recommendation?" asked Mr. Damon.
</P>

<P>
"Yes," replied Tom. "Or rather, it will be when I have it perfected.
Aeroplane motors now are about as compact and speedy as they can be
made. It is only the terrific noise that is a handicap. It is a
handicap to the pilots and observers in the craft, as they cannot
communicate except through a special speaking tube, and this is not
always satisfactory or sure. Then, too, the noise of an airship
proclaims its approach to the enemy, sometimes long before it can be
seen.
</P>

<P>
"With a silent motor all this would be done away with. With my new
craft, in case I can perfect it, the enemy's lines can be approached as
silently as the Indians used to approach the log cabins of the white
settlers. That will be its great advantage&mdash;not that conversation can
be more easily carried on, for that is, after all, an unimportant
detail. But to approach the enemy's lines in the silence of the night
would be a distinct gain."
</P>

<P>
"I believe it would, Tom!" exclaimed Mr. Damon. "And I should think,
too, that Uncle Sam would be glad to get such a motor," he added.
</P>

<P>
"Well, he'll have one to take if he wants it, if I can make my plans a
success," declared Tom. "That is, unless those other fellows get ahead
of me."
</P>

<P>
"What other fellows?" asked Mr. Damon.
</P>

<P>
"Gale, Ware and their crowd," was the answer. "I fancy they are
provoked because I wouldn't agree to work for them, and now, that Gale
overheard&mdash;as he must have&mdash;what I propose working on, they may try
that game themselves."
</P>

<P>
"You mean try to turn out a silent motor?"
</P>

<P>
"Yes. It would be a big feather in their cap for their company, so far,
hasn't been very successful on government orders. That's why they came
to me, I guess."
</P>

<P>
"I shouldn't be surprised, Tom," conceded Mr. Damon. "Since the
government accepted your giant cannon and your great searchlight, you
have come into greater prominence than ever before. And those two
things are a wonderful success."
</P>

<P>
"Yes," admitted Tom, modestly enough, "the big electric light seems to
have been of some benefit on the European battle front, and though they
haven't been able to make and transport as many of my giant cannons as
I'd like to see over there, it is progressing, I understand."
</P>

<P>
And this is true. For the details of these two inventions of Tom
Swift's I refer my readers to the books bearing those titles.
Sufficient to state here that the government was using these two
inventions, and there had been no necessity for commandeering them
either, since Tom had freely offered them at the declaration of war
with Germany.
</P>

<P>
"Well, since I can't help you with my 'Whizzer,'" said Mr. Damon, with
a smile, "let me do what I can toward your silent motor, Tom. What are
you going to call it?"
</P>

<P>
"Oh, I don't know&mdash;hadn't thought of a name. I guess 'Air Scout' would
be as good as any. That's what it will be&mdash;a machine for silently
scouting in the air. And now to get down to brass tacks, as the poet
says, I believe I will&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
"Gentleman to see you, Mr. Swift," interrupted Jackson.
</P>

<P>
"Bless my penwiper!" cried Mr. Damon. "More visitors! I hope it isn't
Gale or Ware come back to see what they can spy on!"

CHAPTER VII

<H3 ALIGN="center">
A PROBLEM IN SOUND
</H3>

<P>
Tom Swift looked up with a distinct appearance of being annoyed that
was unusual with him, for he was, nearly always, good-natured. But the
frown that had replaced the pleasant look on his face while he was
talking to Mr. Damon about the projected new air scout was at once
wiped away as he looked at the card Jackson held out to him.
</P>

<P>
"Bring him in right away!" he ordered. "He needn't have stood on that
ceremony."
</P>

<P>
"Well, he said it was a business call," returned the mechanician with a
cheerful grin, "and he said he wanted it done according to form. So he
gave me his card to bring you."
</P>

<P>
"Who is it?" asked Mr. Damon, with the privilege of an old friend.
</P>

<P>
"It's Ned Newton," Tom answered; "though why he's putting on all this
formality I can't fathom."
</P>

<P>
Jackson went back to the main gate and told the man on guard there to
admit Ned, who had so formally sent in his card.
</P>

<P>
"Ah, Mr. Swift, I believe?" began the bank employee with that suave,
formal air which usually precedes a business meeting.
</P>

<P>
"That is my name," said Tom, with a suppressed grin, and he spoke as
stiffly as though to a perfect stranger.
</P>

<P>
"Mr. Tom Swift, the great inventor?" went on Ned.
</P>

<P>
"Yes."
</P>

<P>
"Ah, then I am at the right place. Just sign here, please, on the
dotted line," and he held out a blank form, and a fountain pen to Tom,
who took them half mechanically.
</P>

<P>
"Huh? What's the big idea, Ned?" asked the young inventor, unable
longer to carry on the joke. "Is this a warrant for my arrest, or
merely a testimonial to you. If it's the latter, and concerns your
nerve, I'll gladly sign it."
</P>

<P>
"Well, it's something like that!" laughed Ned. "That's your application
for another block of Liberty Bonds, Tom, and I want you, as a personal
favor to me, as a business favor to the bank, and as your plain duty to
Uncle Sam, to double your last subscription."
</P>

<P>
Tom looked at the sum Ned had filled in on the blank form, and uttered
a slight whistle of surprise.
</P>

<P>
"That's all right now," said Ned, with the air of a professional
salesman. "You can stand that and more, too. I'm letting you off easy.
Why, I got Mary's father&mdash;Mr. Nestor&mdash;for twice what he took last time,
and Mary herself&mdash;hard as she's working for the Red Cross&mdash;gave me a
nice application. So it's up to you to&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
"Nuff said!" exclaimed Tom, sententiously, as he signed his name. "I
may have to reconsider my recent refusal of the offer of the Universal
Flying Machine Company, though, if I haven't money enough to meet this
subscription, Ned."
</P>

<P>
"Oh, you'll meet it all right! Much obliged," and Ned folded the
Liberty Bond subscription paper and put it in his pocket.  "But did you
turn down the offer from those people?"
</P>

<P>
"I did," answered Tom. "But how did you know about it, Ned?"
</P>

<P>
"First let me say that I'm glad you decided to have nothing to do with
them. They're a rich firm, and have lots of money, but I wouldn't trust
'em, even if they have some government contracts.  The way I happened
to know they were likely to make you an offer is this," continued Ned
Newton.
</P>

<P>
"They do business with one of the New York banks with which my
bank&mdash;notice the accent on the my, Tom&mdash;is connected. The other day I
happened to see some correspondence about you. These flying machine
people asked our bank to find out certain things about you, and, as a
matter of business, we had to give the information. Sort of a
commercial agency report, you know, nothing unusual, and it isn't the
first time it's been done since your business got so large. But that's
how I happened to know these fellows contemplated dickering with you."
</P>

<P>
"Do you know Gale or Ware?" Tom asked.
</P>

<P>
"Not personally. But in a business way, Tom, I'd warn you to look out
for them, as they're sharp dealers. They put one over on the government
all right, and there may be some unpleasant publicity to it later. But
they're putting up a big bluff, and pretending they can turn out a lot
of flying machines for use in Europe. Why don't you get busy on that
end of the game, Tom?"
</P>

<P>
"I know you've more than done your bit, with Liberty Bonds,
subscriptions to the Y. M. C. A. and other war work, besides your war
tank and other inventions. But you're such a shark on flying machines I
should think you'd offer your factory to the government for the
production of aeroplanes."
</P>

<P>
"I would in a minute, Ned, and you know it; but the fact of the matter
is my shops aren't equipped for the production of anything in large
numbers. We do mostly an experimenting business here, making only one
or two of a certain machine. I have told the government officials they
can have anything I've got, and you know they wouldn't let me enlist
when I was working on the war tank."
</P>

<P>
"Yes, I remember that," said Ned. "You're no slacker! I wanted to
shoulder a rifle, too, but they keep me at this Liberty Loan work.
Well, Uncle Sam ought to know."
</P>

<P>
"That's what I say," agreed Tom, "and that's why I haven't gone to the
front myself. And now, as it happens, I've got something else in mind
that may help Uncle Sam."
</P>

<P>
"What is it?"
</P>

<P>
"A silent flying machine for scout work on the battle front," Tom told
his friend, and then he gave a few details, such as those he had been
telling Mr. Damon.
</P>

<P>
"Then I don't wonder you turned down the offer of the Universal
people," remarked Ned, at the conclusion of the recital. "This will be
a heap more help to the government, Tom, than working for those people,
even at twenty-five thousand dollars a year. And if you get short, and
can't meet your newest Liberty Bond payments, why, I guess the bank
will stretch your credit a little."
</P>

<P>
"Thanks!" laughed Tom, "but I'll try not to ask them."
</P>

<P>
The friends talked together a little longer, and then Ned had to take
his departure to solicit more subscriptions, while Mr. Damon went with
him, the eccentric man saying he would go home to Waterfield.
</P>

<P>
"But, bless my overshoes, Tom!" he exclaimed, as he departed, "don't
forget to let me know when you have your silent motor working. I want
to see it."
</P>

<P>
"I'll let you know," was the promise given by the young inventor.
</P>

<P>
"And watch out for those Universal people," warned Ned. "I'm not
telling you this as a bank official, for I'm not supposed to, but it's
personal."
</P>

<P>
"I'll be on the watch," said Tom. And, as he went into his private
workshop, he wondered why it was his father and Ned had both warned him
not to trust Gale and Ware.
</P>

<P>
The next few days were busy ones for Tom Swift. Once he had made up his
mind to go to work seriously on a silent motor, all else was put aside.
He sent a note to Mary Nestor, telling her what he was going to do,
and, asking her to say nothing about it, which, of course, Mary agreed
to.
</P>

<P>
"Come and see me when you can," she sent back word, "but I know you
won't have much chance when you're experimenting with your invention.
And I shall be working so hard for the Red Cross that I sha'n't get
much chance to entertain you. But the war can't last forever."
</P>

<P>
"No," agreed Tom with a sigh, as he put away her letter, "and thank
goodness that it can't!"
</P>

<P>
The young inventor threw himself into the perplexing work of inventing
a silent motor with all the fervor he had given to the production of
his war tank, his giant cannon, his wonderful searchlight and other
machines.
</P>

<P>
"And," mused Tom, as he sat at his work table with pencil and paper
before him, "since this is a problem in acoustics, I had best begin I
suppose by going back to first principles, and after determining what
makes an aeroplane engine noisy, try to figure out how to make it
quiet. Now as to the first, the principle causes of noise are&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
And at that instant there broke on Tom's ears a succession of
discordant sounds which seemed to be a combination of an Indian's war
whoop and a college student's yells at a football game.
</P>

<P>
"Now I wonder what that is!" mused the young inventor as he hastily
arose. "Better solve that problem before I tackle the aeroplane motor."
</P>

CHAPTER VIII
</H3>

<H3 ALIGN="center">
THROUGH THE ROOF
</H3>

<P>
Tom rushed from his private office, and when he reached the outer door
he heard with more distinctness the sounds that had alarmed him. They
seemed to come from a small building given over to electrical
apparatus, and which, at the time, was not supposed to be in use. It
had been Tom's workroom, so to speak, when he was developing his
electric runabout and rifle, but of late he had not spent much time in
it.
</P>

<P>
"Somebody's in there!" reflected the young inventor, as he heard yells
coming from the open door of the place. "And if it isn't Koku and
Eradicate I miss my guess! Wonder what they can be doing there."
</P>

<P>
He crossed the yard between his private office and the electrical shop
in a few rapid strides, and, as he entered the latter place, he was
greeted with a series of wild yells.
</P>

<P>
"Good volume of sound here, at all events," mused Tom. "Almost as much
as my motor made when I was trying to talk to Mary. Hello there! What's
going on? Is any one hurt? What's the matter?" he cried, for, at first,
he could see no one in the dim light of the place. The interior was a
maze of electrical apparatus.
</P>

<P>
"Who's here?" demanded Tom, as he advanced.
</P>

<P>
"Oh, Master! Come quick! Koku 'most dead an' no can let go!" was the
cry.
</P>

<P>
"Yo' jest bet yo' cain't let go!" chimed in the voice of Eradicate. "I
done knowed yo would git into trouble ef yo' come heah, an' I'se glad
ob it! So I is!"
</P>

<P>
"What is it, Rad? What has happened to Koku?" cried Tom, running
forward, for though no very powerful current could be turned on in the
electrical shop at this period of unuse, there was enough to be very
painful. "What is it, Rad?"
</P>

<P>
"Oh, dat big foolish giant, Koku, done got his se'f into trouble!"
chuckled the colored man. "He done got holt ob one ob dem air
contraptions, Massa Tom, an' he cain't let go! Ha! Ha!  Golly! Look at
him squirm!" and Rad laughed shrilly, which accounted for some of the
sounds Tom had heard.
</P>

<P>
Then came yells of rage and pain from the giant, and they were so loud
and vigorous, mingling with Eradicate's as they did, that it was no
wonder Tom was startled. The sounds were heard in the other shops, and
men came running out. But before then Tom had put an end to the trouble.
</P>

<P>
One look showed him what had happened. Just how or why Koku and
Eradicate had entered the electrical shop Tom did not then stop to
inquire. But he saw that the giant had grasped the handles of one of
the electric machines, designed for charging Leyden jars used in Tom's
experiments, and the powerful, though not dangerous, current had so
paralyzed, temporarily, the muscles of the giant's hands and arms that
he could not let go, and there he was, squirming, and not knowing how
to turn off the current, and unable to ease himself, while Eradicate
stood and laughed at him, fairly howling with delight.
</P>

<P>
"Ha! Guess yo' won't do no mo' spadin' in' Massa Tom's garden right
away, big man!" taunted Eradicate.
</P>

<P>
"Be quiet, Rad!" ordered Tom, as he reached up and pulled out the
switch, thus shutting off the current. "This isn't anything to laugh
at."
</P>

<P>
"But he done look so funny, Massa Tom!" pleaded the colored man. "He
done squirm laik&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
But Eradicate did not finish what he intended to say. Once free from
the powerful current, the giant looked at his numb hands, and then,
seeming to think that Eradicate was the cause of it all, he sprang at
the colored man with a yell. But Eradicate did not stay to see what
would happen. With a howl of terror, he raced out of the door, and, old
and rheumatic as he was, he managed to gain the stable of his mule,
Boomerang, over which he had his humble but comfortable quarters.
</P>

<P>
"Well, I guess he's safe for a while!" laughed Tom, as he saw the giant
turn away, shaking his fist at the closed door, for Koku, big as he
was, stood in mortal terror of the mule's heels.
</P>

<P>
Tom locked the door of the electrical shop and went back to his
interrupted problem. From Jackson he learned that Koku and Eradicate
had merely happened to stroll into the forbidden place, which had been
left open by accident. There, it appeared, Koku had handled some of the
machinery, ending by switching on the current of the machine the
handles of which he later unsuspectingly picked up. Then he received a
shock he long remembered, and for many days he believed Eradicate had
been responsible for it, and there was more than the usual hostile
feeling between the two. But Eradicate was innocent of that trick, at
all events.
</P>

<P>
"Though," said Tom, telling his father about it later, "Rad would have
turned on the current if he had known he could make trouble for Koku by
it. I never saw their like for having disagreements!"
</P>

<P>
"Yes, but they are both devoted to you, Tom," said the aged inventor.
"But what is this you hinted at&mdash;a silent motor you called it, I
believe? Are you really serious in trying to invent one?"
</P>

<P>
"Yes, Dad, I am. I think there's a big field for an aeroplane that
could travel along over the enemy's lines&mdash;particularly at night&mdash;and
not be heard from below. Think of the scout work that could be done.
</P>

<P>
"Well, yes, it could be done if you could get a silent motor, or
propellers that made no noise, Tom. But I don't believe it can be done."
</P>

<P>
"Well, maybe not, Dad. But I'm going to try!" and Tom, after a further
talk with his father, began work in earnest on the big problem. That it
was a big one Tom was not disposed to deny, and that it would be a
valuable invention even his somewhat skeptical father admitted.
</P>

<P>
"How are you going to start, Tom?" asked Mr. Swift, several days after
the big idea had come to the young man.
</P>

<P>
"I'm going to experiment a bit, at first. I've got a lot of old motors,
that weren't speedy enough for any of my flying machines, and I'm going
to make them over. If I spoil them the loss won't amount to anything,
and if I succeed&mdash;well, maybe I can help out Uncle Sam a bit more."
</P>

<P>
As Tom had said he would do, he began at the very foundation, and
studied the fundamental principles of sound.
</P>

<P>
"Sound," the young inventor told Ned Newton, in speaking about the
problem, "is a sensation which is peculiar to the ear, though the
vibrations caused by sound waves may be felt in many parts of the body.
But the ear is the great receiver of sound."
</P>

<P>
"You aren't going to invent a sort of muffler for the ears, are you,
Tom?" asked Ned. "That would be an easy way of solving the problem, but
I doubt if you could get the Germans to wear your ear-tabs so they
wouldn't hear the sound of the Allied aeroplanes."
</P>

<P>
"No, I'm not figuring on doing the trick that way," said Tom with a
laugh. "I've really got to cut down the sound of the motor and the
propeller blades, so a person, listening with all his ears, won't hear
any noise, unless he's within a few feet of the plane."
</P>

<P>
"Well, I can tell you, right off the reel, how to do it," said the bank
employee.
</P>

<P>
"How?" asked Tom eagerly.
</P>

<P>
"Run your engine and propellers in a vacuum," was the prompt reply.
</P>

<P>
"Hum!" said Tom, musingly. "Yes, that would be a simple way out, and
I'll do it, if you'll tell me how to breathe in a vacuum."
</P>

<P>
"Oh, I didn't agree to do that," laughed Ned.
</P>

<P>
But he had spoken the truth, as those who have studied physics well
know. There must be an atmosphere for the transmission of sound, which
is the reason all is cold and silent and still at the moon. There is no
atmosphere there. Sound implies vibration.  Something, such as liquid,
gas, or solid, must be set in motion to produce sound, and for the
purpose of science the air we breathe may be considered a gas, being
composed of two.
</P>

<P>
Not only must the object, either solid, liquid, or gaseous, be in
motion to produce sound, but the air surrounding the vibrating body
must also be moving in unison with it. And lastly there must be some
medium of receiving the sound waves&mdash;the ear or some part of the body.
Totally deaf persons may be made aware of sound through the vibrations
received through their hands or feet. They receive, of course, only the
more intense, or largest, sound waves, and can not hear notes of music
nor spoken words, though they may feel the vibration when a piano is
played. And, as Ned has said, no sound is produced in a vacuum.
</P>

<P>
"But," said Tom, "since I can't run my aeroplane in a vacuum, or even
have the propellers revolve in one, it's up to me to solve the problem
some other way. The propellers don't really make noise enough to worry
about when they're high in the air.  It's the exhaust from the motor,
and to get rid of that will be my first attempt."
</P>

<P>
"Can it be done?" asked Ned.
</P>

<P>
"I don't know," was Tom's frank answer.
</P>

<P>
"They do it on an automobile to a great extent," went on Ned.  "Some of
'em you cant hardly hear."
</P>

<P>
"Yes, but an aeroplane engine runs many, many times faster than the
motor of an auto," said Tom, "and there are more explosions to muffle.
I doubt if the muffler of an auto would cut down the sound of an aero
engine to any appreciable extent. But, of course, I'll try along those
lines."
</P>

<P>
"They have mufflers or silencers for guns and rifles," went on Ned.
"Couldn't you make a big one of those contraptions and put it on an
aeroplane?"
</P>

<P>
"I doubt it," said Tom, shaking his head. "Of course it's the same
principle as that in an auto muffler, or on a motor boat&mdash;a series of
baffle plates arranged within a hollow cylinder. But all such devices
cut down power, and I don't want to do that.  However, I'm going to
solve the problem or&mdash;bust!"
</P>

<P>
And Tom came near "busting," Ned remarked later, when he and his friend
talked over the progress of the invention.
</P>

<P>
Two weeks had passed since the start of his evolution of his new idea,
and following the visiting of the representatives of the Universal
Flying Machine Company. Since then neither Gale nor Ware had
communicated with Tom.
</P>

<P>
"But I must be on the watch against them," thought the young inventor.
"I'm pretty sure Gale heard me mention what I was going to try to
invent, and he may get ahead of me, and put a silent motor on the
market first. Not that I'm afraid of being done out of any profits, but
I simply don't want to be beaten."
</P>

<P>
The details of Tom's invention cannot be gone into, but, roughly, it
was based on the principle of not only a muffler but also of producing
less noise when the charges of gasoline exploded in the cylinders. It
is, of course, the explosion of gasoline mixed with air that causes an
internal combustion engine to operate. And it is the expulsion of the
burned gases that causes the exhaust and makes the noise that is heard.
</P>

<P>
Tom was working along the well-known line of the rate of travel of
sound, which progresses at the rate of about 1090 feet a second when
air is at the freezing point. And, roughly, with every degree increase
in the atmosphere's temperature the velocity of sound increases by one
foot. Thus at a temperature of 100 degrees Fahrenheit, or 68 degrees
above freezing, there would be added to the 1090 feet the 68 feet,
making sound travel at 100 degrees Fahrenheit about 1158 feet a second.
</P>

<P>
Tom had set up in his shop a powerful, but not very speedy, old
aeroplane engine, and had attached to it the device he hoped would help
him toward solving his problem of cutting down the noise. He had had
some success with it, and, after days and nights of labor, he invited
his father and Ned, as well as Mr. Damon, over to see what he hoped
would be a final experiment.
</P>

<P>
His visitors had assembled in the shop, and Eradicate was setting out
some refreshments which Tom had provided, the colored man being in his
element now.
</P>

<P>
"What's all this figuring, Tom?" asked Mr. Damon, as he saw a series of
calculations on some sheets of paper lying on Tom's desk.
</P>

<P>
"That's where I worked out how much faster sound traveled in hydrogen
gas than in the ordinary atmosphere," was the answer.  "It goes about
four times as fast, or nearly four thousand two hundred feet a second.
You remember the rule, I suppose. 'The speed of sonorous vibrations
through gases varies inversely as the squares of the weights of equal
volumes of the gases,' or, in other words&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
"Give it to us chiefly in 'other words,' if you please, Tom!" pleaded
Ned, with a laugh. "Let that go and do some tricks. Start the engine
and let's see if we can hear it."
</P>

<P>
"Oh, you can hear it all right," said Tom, as he approached the motor,
which was mounted on a testing block. "The thing isn't perfected yet,
but I hope to have it soon. Rad! Where is that black rascal? Oh, there
you are! Come here, Rad!"
</P>

<P>
"Yaas sah, Massa Tom! Is I gwine to help yo' all in dish yeah job?"
</P>

<P>
"Yes. Just take hold of this lever, and when I say so pull it as hard
as you can."
</P>

<P>
"Dat's whut I will, Massa Tom. Golly! ef dat no 'count giant was heah
now he'd see he ain't de only one whut's got muscle.  I'll pull good
an' hard, Massa Tom."
</P>

<P>
"Yes, that's what I want you to. Now I guess we're all ready.  Can you
see, Dad&mdash;and Ned and Mr. Damon?"
</P>

<P>
"Yes," they answered. They stood near the side wall of the shop, while
Tom and Eradicate were at the testing block, on which the motor, with
the noise-eliminating devices attached, had been temporarily mounted.
</P>

<P>
"All ready," called the young inventor, as he turned on the gas and
threw over the electrical switch. "All ready! Pull the starting lever,
Rad, and when it's been running a little I'll throw on the silencer and
you can see the difference."
</P>

<P>
The motor began to hum, and there was a deafening roar, just as there
always is when the engine of an aeroplane starts. It was as though half
a dozen automobile engines were being run with the mufflers cut out.
</P>

<P>
"Now I'll show you the difference!" yelled Tom, though such was the
noise that not a word could be heard. "This shows you what my silencer
will do."
</P>

<P>
Tom pulled another lever. There was at once a cessation of the
deafening racket, though it was not altogether ended. Then, after a
moment or two, there suddenly came a roar as though a blast had been
let off in the shop.
</P>

<P>
Tom and Eradicate were tossed backward, head over heels, as though by
the giant hands of Koku himself, and Mr. Damon, Ned, and Tom's father
saw the motor fly from the testing block and shoot through the roof of
the building with a rending, crashing, and splintering sound that could
be heard for a mile.

CHAPTER IX
</H3>

<H3 ALIGN="center">
AFTER A SPY
</H3>

<P>
Curious as it may seem, Eradicate, the oldest and certainly not the
most energetic of the party assembled in the experiment room, was the
first to recover himself and arise. Tottering to his feet he gave one
look at the testing block, whence the motor had torn itself. Then he
looked at the prostrate figures around him, none of them hurt, but all
stunned and very much startled. Then the gaze of Eradicate traveled to
the hole in the roof. It was a gaping, ragged hole, for the motor was
heavy and the roof of flimsy material. And then the colored man
exclaimed:
</P>

<P>
"Good land ob massy! Did I do dat?"
</P>

<P>
His tone was one of such startled contrition, and so tragic, that Tom
Swift, rueful as he felt over the failure of his experiment and the
danger they had all been in, could not help laughing.
</P>

<P>
"I take it, hearing that from you, Tom, that we're all right," said Ned
Newton, as he recovered himself and brushed some dirt off his coat. Ned
was a natty dresser.
</P>

<P>
"Yes, we seem to be all right," replied Tom slowly. "I can't say what
damage the flying motor has done outside, but&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
"Bless my insurance policy! but what happened?" asked Mr. Damon. "I saw
Eradicate pull on that lever as you told him to, Tom, and then things
all went topsy-turvy! Did he pull the wrong handle?"
</P>

<P>
"No, it wasn't Rad's fault at all," said Tom. "The trouble was, as I
guess I'll find when I investigate, that I put too much power into the
motor, and the muffler didn't give any chance for the accumulated
exhaust gases to expand and escape. I didn't allow for that, and they
simply backed up, compressed and exploded. I guess that's the whole
explanation."
</P>

<P>
"I'm inclined to agree with you, Son," said Mr. Swift dryly.  "Don't
try to get rid of all the noise at once. Eliminate it by degrees and it
will be safer."
</P>

<P>
"I guess so," agreed Tom.
</P>

<P>
By this time a score of workmen from the other shops had congregated
around the one though the roof of which the motor had been blown. Tom
opened the door to assure Jackson and the others that no one was hurt,
and then the young inventor saw the exploded motor had buried in the
dirt a short distance away from the experiment building.
</P>

<P>
"Lucky none of us were standing over it when it went up," said Tom, as
he made an inspection of the broken machine. "We'd have gone through
the roof with it."
</P>

<P>
"She certainly went sailing!" commented Ned. "Must have been a lot of
power there, Tom."
</P>

<P>
And this was evidenced by the bent and twisted rods that had held the
motor to the testing block, and by the cylinders, some of which were
torn apart as though made of paper instead of heavy steel. But for the
fact that all the force of the explosion was directly upward, instead
of at the sides, none might have been left alive in the shop. All had
escaped most fortunately, and they realized this.
</P>

<P>
"Well," queried Ned, as Tom gave orders to have the damaged machine
removed and the roof repaired, "does this end the wonderful silent
motor, Tom?"
</P>

<P>
"End it! What do you mean&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
"I mean are you going to experiment any further?"
</P>

<P>
"Why, of course! Just because I've had one failure doesn't mean that
I'm going to give up. Especially when I know what the matter was&mdash;not
leaving any vent for the escaping gases. Why this isn't anything. When
I was perfecting my giant cannon I was nearly blown up more than once,
and you remember how we got stuck in the submarine."
</P>

<P>
"I should say I did!" exclaimed Ned with a shudder. "I don't want any
more of that. But as between being blown through a roof and held at the
bottom of the sea, I don't know that there's much choice."
</P>

<P>
"Well, perhaps not," agreed Tom. "But as for ending my experiments, I
wouldn't dream of such a thing! Why, I've only just begun! I'll have a
silent motor yet!"
</P>

<P>
"And a non-explosive one, I hope," added Mr. Damon dryly.  "Bless my
shoe buttons, Tom, but if my wife knew what danger I'd been in she'd
never let me come over to see you any more."
</P>

<P>
"Well, the next time I invite you to a test I'll be more careful,"
promised the young inventor.
</P>

<P>
"There isn't going to be any next time as far as I'm concerned!"
laughed Ned. "I think it's safer to sell Liberty Bonds."
</P>

<P>
And, though they joked about it, they all realized the narrow escape
they had had. As for Eradicate, once he knew he had not been the one
who caused the damage, he felt rather proud of the part he had taken in
the mishap, and for many days he boasted about it to Koku.
</P>

<P>
True to his determination, Tom Swift did not give up his experimental
work on the silent motor. The machine that had been blown through the
roof was useless now, and it was sent to the scrap heap, after as much
of it as possible had been salvaged.  Then Tom got another piece of
apparatus out of his store room and began all over again.
</P>

<P>
He worked along the same lines as at first&mdash;providing a chamber for the
escaping gases of the exhaust to expend their noise and energy in, at
the same time laboring to cut down the concussion of the explosions in
the cylinder without reducing their force any. And that it was no easy
problem to do either of these, Tom had to admit as he progressed. All
previous types of mufflers or silencers had to be discarded and a new
one evolved.
</P>

<P>
"Jackson, I need some one to help me," said Tom to his chief
mechanician one day. "Haven't you a good man who is used to
experimental work that you can let me take from the works?"
</P>

<P>
"Why, yes," was the answer. "Let me see. Roberts is busy on the new
bomb you got up, but I could take him off that&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
"No, don't!" interposed Tom. "I want that work to go on. Isn't there
some one else you can let me have?"
</P>

<P>
"Well, there's a new man who came to me well recommended. I took him on
last week, and he's a wonderful mechanic. Knows a lot about gas
engines. I could let you have him&mdash;Bower his name is.  The only thing
about it, though, is that I don't like to give you a man of whom I am
not dead certain, when you're working on a new device."
</P>

<P>
"Oh, that will be all right," said Tom. "There won't be any secrets he
can get, if you mean you think he might be up to spy work."
</P>

<P>
"That's what I did mean, Tom. You never can tell, you know, and you
have some bitter enemies."
</P>

<P>
"Yes, but I'll take care this man doesn't see the plans, or any of my
drawings. I only want some one to do the heavy assembling work on the
experimental muffler I'm getting up. We can let him think it's for a
new kind of automobile."
</P>

<P>
"Oh, then I guess it will be all right. I'll send Bower to you."
</P>

<P>
Tom rather liked the new workman, who seemed quiet and efficient. He
did not ask questions, either, about the machine on which he was
engaged, but did as he was told. As Tom had said, he kept his plans and
drawing under lock and key&mdash;in a safe to be exact&mdash;and he did not think
they were in any danger from his new helper.
</P>

<P>
But Tom Swift held into altogether too slight regard the powers of
those who were opposed to him. He did not appreciate the depths to
which they would stoop to gain their ends.
</P>

<P>
He had been working hard on his new device, and had reached a point
further along than when the other motor had exploded. He began to see
success ahead of him, and he was jubilant. Whether this made him
careless does not matter, but the fact was that he left Bower more to
himself, and alone in the experimental shop several times.
</P>

<P>
And it was on one of these occasions, when Tom had been for some time
in one of the other shops, where he and Jackson were in consultation
over a new machine, that as he came back to the test room unexpectedly,
he saw Bower move hastily away from in front of the safe. Moreover, Tom
was almost certain he had heard the steel door clang shut as he
approached the building.
</P>

<P>
And then, before he could ask his helper a question, Tom looked from a
window and saw a stranger running hastily along the side of the
building where his trial motor was being set up.
</P>

<P>
"Who's that? Who is that man? Did he come in here? Was he tampering
with my safe?" cried Tom. He saw Bower hesitate and change color, and
Tom knew it was time to act.
</P>

<P>
The window was open, and with one bound the young inventor was out and
running after the stranger he had seen departing in such a hurry. The
man was but a short distance ahead of him, and Tom saw he was stuffing
some papers into his pocket.
</P>

<P>
"Here! Come back! Stop!" ordered Tom, but the man ran on the faster.
</P>

<P>
"That's a spy as sure as guns!" reflected Tom Swift. "And Bower is in
with him!" he added. "I've got to catch that fellow!" and he speeded
his pace as he ran after the fellow.
</P>

CHAPTER X
</H3>

<H3 ALIGN="center">
A BIG SPLASH
</H3>

<P>
There was no question in the mind of Tom Swift but that the man he was
running after was guilty of some wrong-doing. In the first place he was
a stranger, and had no right inside the big fence that surrounded the
Swift machine plant. Then, too, the very fact that he ran away was
suspicious.
</P>

<P>
And this, coupled with the confusion on the part of Bower, and his
proximity to the safe, made Tom fear that some of his plans had been
stolen. These he was very anxious to recover if this strange man had
them, and so he raced after him with all speed.
</P>

<P>
"Stop! Stop!" called Tom, but the on-racing stranger did not heed.
</P>

<P>
The cries of the young inventor soon attracted the attention of his
men, and Jackson and some of the others came running from their various
shops to give whatever aid was needed. But they were all too far away
to give effective chase.
</P>

<P>
"Bower might have come with me if he had wanted to help," thought Tom.
But a backward glance over his shoulder did not show that the new
helper was engaging in the pursuit, and he could have started almost on
the same terms as Tom himself.
</P>

<P>
The runaway, looking back to see how near the young inventor was to
him, suddenly changed his course, and, noting this, Tom Swift thought:
</P>

<P>
"I've got him now! He'll be bogged if he runs that way," for the way
led to a piece of swampy land that, after the recent rains, was a
veritable bog which was dangerous for cattle at least; and more than
one man had been caught there.
</P>

<P>
"He can't run across the swamp, that's sure," reflected Tom with some
satisfaction. "I'll get him all right!"
</P>

<P>
But he wanted to capture the man, if possible, before he reached the
bog, and, to this end, Tom increased his speed to such good end that
presently, on the firm ground that bordered the swamp, Tom was almost
within reaching distance of the stranger.
</P>

<P>
But the latter kept up running, and dodged and turned so that Tom could
not lay hands on him. Suddenly, turning around a clump of trees the
fleeing man headed straight for a veritable mud hole that lay directly
in his path. It was part of the swamp&mdash;the most liquid part of the bog
and a home of frogs and lizards.
</P>

<P>
Too late, the man, who was evidently unaware of the proximity of the
swamp, saw his danger. His further flight was cut off by the mud hole,
but it was too late to turn back. Tom Swift was at his heels now, and
seeing that it was impossible to grab the man, Tom did the next best
thing. He stuck out his foot and tripped him, and tripped him right on
the edge of the mud hole, so that the man fell in with a big splash,
the muddy water flying all around, some even over the young inventor.
</P>

<P>
For a moment the man disappeared completely beneath the surface, for
the mud hole was rather deep just where Tom had thrown him. Then there
was another violent agitation of the surface, and a very woebegone and
muddy face was raised from the slough, followed by the rest of the
figure of the man. Slowly he got to his feet, mud and water dripping
from him. He cleared his face by rubbing his hands over it, not that it
made his countenance clean, but it removed masses of mud from his eyes,
nose, and mouth, so that he could see and speak, though his first
operation was to gasp for breath.
</P>

<P>
"What&mdash;what are you doin'?" he demanded of Tom, and as the man opened
his mouth to speak Tom was aware of a glitter, which disclosed the
'fact that the man had a large front tooth of gold.
</P>

<P>
"What am I doing?" repeated Tom. "I think it's up to you to answer that
question, not me. What are you doing?"
</P>

<P>
"You&mdash;you tripped me into this mud hole!" declared the man.
</P>

<P>
"I did, yes; because you were trespassing on my property, and ran away
instead of stopping when I told you to," went on Tom.  "Who are you and
what are you doing? What were you doing with Bower at my shop?"
</P>

<P>
"Nothin'! I wasn't doin' nothin'!"
</P>

<P>
"Well, we'll inquire into that. I want to see what you have in your
pockets before I believe you. Come on out!"
</P>

<P>
"You haven't any right to go through my pockets!" blustered the
stranger.
</P>

<P>
"Oh, haven't I? Well, I'm going to take the right. Jackson&mdash;Koku&mdash;just
see that he doesn't get away. We'll take him back and search him," and
Tom motioned to his chief machinist and the giant, who had reached the
scene, to take charge of the man. But Koku was sufficient for this
purpose, and the mud-bespattered stranger seemed to shrink as he saw
the big creature approach him. There was no question of running away
after that.
</P>

<P>
"Bring him along," ordered Tom, and Koku, taking a tight grip on the
man by the slack of his garments behind, walked him along toward the
office, the mud and water splashing and oozing from his shoes at every
step.
</P>

<P>
"Now you look here!" the gold-toothed man cried, as he was forced
along, "you ain't got any right to detain me. I ain't done nothin'!"
And each time he spoke the bright tooth in his mouth glittered in the
sun.
</P>

<P>
"I don't know whether you've done anything or not," said Tom.  "I'm
going to take you back and see what you and Bower have to say. He may
know something about this."
</P>

<P>
"If he does I don't believe he'll tell," said Jackson.
</P>

<P>
"Why not?" asked Tom, quickly.
</P>

<P>
"Because he's gone."
</P>

<P>
"Gone! Bower gone?"
</P>

<P>
"Yes," answered Jackson. "I saw him running out of the experiment shop
as we raced along to help you. I didn't think, at the time, that he was
doing more than go for aid, perhaps. But I see the game now."
</P>

<P>
"Oh, you mean&mdash;him?" and Tom pointed to the dripping figure.
</P>

<P>
"Yes," said Jackson in a low voice, as Koku went on ahead with his
prisoner. "If, as you say, this man was in league with Bower, the
latter has smelled a rat and skipped. He has run away, and I only hope
he hasn't done any damage or got hold of any of your plans."
</P>

<P>
"We'll soon know about that," said Tom. "I wonder who is at the bottom
of this?"
</P>

<P>
"Maybe those men you wouldn't work for," suggested the machinist.
</P>

<P>
"You mean Gale and Ware of the Universal Flying Machine Company?"
</P>

<P>
"Yes."
</P>

<P>
"Oh, I don't believe they'd stoop to any such measures as this&mdash;sending
spies around," replied Tom. "But I can't be too careful.  We'll
investigate."
</P>

<P>
The first result of the investigation was to disclose the fact that
Bower was gone. He had taken his few possessions and left the Swift
plant while Tom was racing after the stranger. A hasty examination of
the safe did not reveal anything missing, as Tom's plans and papers
were intact. But they showed evidences of having been looked over, for
they were out of the regular order in which the young inventor kept
them.
</P>

<P>
"I begin to see it," said Tom, musingly. "Bower must have managed to
open the safe while I was gone, and he must have made a hasty copy of
some of the drawings of the silent motor, and passed them out of the
window to this gold-tooth man, who tried to make off with them. Did you
find anything on him?" he asked, as one of the men who had been
instructed to search the stranger came into the office just then.
</P>

<P>
"Not a thing, Mr. Swift! Not a thing!" was the answer. "We took off
every bit of his clothes and wrapped him in a blanket. He's in the
engine room getting dry now. But there isn't a thing in any of his
pockets."
</P>

<P>
"But I saw him stuffing some papers in as he ran away from me," said
Tom. "We must be sure about this. And don't let the fellow get away
until I question him."
</P>

<P>
"Oh, he's safe enough," answered the man. "Koku is guarding him. He
won't get away."
</P>

<P>
"Then I'll have a look at his clothes," decided Tom. "He may have a
secret pocket."
</P>

<P>
But nothing like this was disclosed, and the most careful search did
not reveal anything incriminating in the man's garments.
</P>

<P>
"He might have thrown away any papers Bower gave him," said Tom. "Maybe
they're at the bottom of the mud hole! If they're there they're safe
enough. But have a search made of the ground where this man ran."
</P>

<P>
This was done, but without result. Some of the workmen even dragged the
mud hole without finding anything. Then Tom and his father had a talk
with the stranger, who refused to give his name. The man was sullen and
angry. He talked loudly about his innocence and of "having the law on"
Tom for having tripped him into the mud.
</P>

<P>
"All right, if you want to make a complaint, go ahead," said the young
inventor. "I'll make one against you for trespass. Why did you come on
my grounds?"
</P>

<P>
"I was going to ask for work. I'm a good machinist and I wanted a job."
</P>

<P>
"How did you get in? Who admitted you at the gate?"
</P>

<P>
"I&mdash;I jest walked in," said the man, but Tom knew this could not be
true, as no strangers were admitted without a permit and none had been
issued. The man denied knowing anything about Bower, but the latter's
flight was evidence enough that something was wrong.
</P>

<P>
Not wishing to go to the trouble of having the man arrested merely as a
trespasser, Tom let him go after his clothes had been dried on a boiler
in one of the shops.
</P>

<P>
"Take him to the gate, and tell him if he comes back he'll get another
dose of the same kind of medicine," ordered Tom to one of the guards at
the plant, and when the latter had reported that this had been done, he
added in an earnest tone:
</P>

<P>
"He went off talking to himself and saying he'd get even with you, Mr.
Swift."
</P>

<P>
"All right," said Tom easily. "I'll be on the watch."
</P>

<P>
The young inventor made a thorough examination of his experiment shop
and the test motor. No damage seemed to have been done, and Tom began
to think he had been too quick for the conspirators, if such they were.
His plans and drawings were intact, and though Bower might have given a
copy to the stranger with the gold tooth, the latter did not take any
away with him.  That he had some papers he wished to conceal and escape
with, seemed certain, but the splash into the mud hole had ended this.
</P>

<P>
No trace was found of Bower, and an effort Tom made to ascertain if the
man was a spy in the employ of Gale and Ware came to naught. The
machinist had come well recommended, and the firm where he was last
employed had nothing but good to say of him.
</P>

<P>
"Well, it's a mystery," decided Tom. "However, I got out of it pretty
well. Only if that gold-tooth individual shows up again he won't get
off so easily."
</P>

<H3 ALIGN="center">
CHAPTER XI
</H3>

<H3 ALIGN="center">
A NIGHT TRIP
</H3>

<P>
Taking a lesson from what had happened, Tom was very much more careful
in the following experiments on his new, silent motor. He made some
changes in his shop, and took Jackson in to help on the new machine,
thus insuring perfect secrecy as the apparatus developed.
</P>

<P>
Tom also changed the safe in which he kept his plans, for the one he
had used previous to the episode in which Bower and the stranger who
took the mud bath figured, was one the combination of which could
easily be ascertained by an expert. The new safe was more complicated,
and Tom felt that his plans, specifications, and formulae which he had
worked out were in less danger.
</P>

<P>
"I can just about figure out what happened," said Ned Newton to Tom,
when told of the circumstances. "These Universal people were provoked
because you wouldn't give them the benefit of your experience on their
flying machines, and so they sent a spy to get work with you. They,
perhaps, hoped to secure some of your ideas for their own, or they may
have had a deeper motive."
</P>

<P>
"What deeper motive could they have, Ned?"</p>

<p>"They might have hoped to
disable you, or some of your machines, so that you couldn't compete
with them. They're unscrupulous, I hear, and will do anything to
succeed and make money. So be on your guard against them."
</P>

<P>
"I will," Tom promised. "But I don't believe there's any more danger
now. Anyhow, I have to take some chances."
</P>

<P>
"Yes, but be as careful as you can. How is the silent motor coming on?"
</P>

<P>
"Pretty good. I've had a lot of failures, and the thing isn't so easy
as I at first imagined it would be. Noise is a funny thing, and I'm
just beginning to understand some of the laws of acoustics we learned
at high school. But I think I'm on the right track with the muffler and
the cutting down of the noise of the explosions in the cylinders. I'm
working both ends, you see&mdash;making a motor that doesn't cause as much
racket as those now in use, and also providing means to take care of
the noise that is made. It isn't possible to make a completely silent
motor of an explosive gas type. The only thing that can be done is to
kill the noise after it is made."
</P>

<P>
"What about the propeller blades?"
</P>

<P>
"Oh, they aren't giving me any trouble. The noise they make can't be
heard a hundred feet in the air, but I am also working on improvements
to the blades. Take it altogether, I'll have an almost silent aeroplane
if my plans come out all right."
</P>

<P>
"Have you said anything to the government yet?"
</P>

<P>
"No; I want to have it pretty well perfected before I do.  Besides, I
don't want any publicity about it until I'm ready. If these Universal
people are after me I'll fool 'em."
</P>

<P>
"That's right, Tom! Well, I must go. Another week of this Liberty Bond
campaign!"
</P>

<P>
"I suppose you'll be glad when it's over."
</P>

<P>
"Well, I don't know," said Ned slowly. "It's part of my small
contribution to Uncle Sam. I'm not like you&mdash;I can't invent things."
</P>

<P>
"But you have an awful smooth line of talk, Ned!" laughed his chum. "I
believe you could sell chloride of sodium to some of the fishes in the
Great Salt Lake&mdash;that is if it has fishes."
</P>

<P>
"I don't know that it has, Tom. And, anyhow, I'm not posing as a salt
salesman," and Ned grinned. "But I must really go. Our bank hasn't
reached its quota in the sale of Liberty Bonds yet, and it's up to me
to see that it doesn't fall down."
</P>

<P>
"Go to it, Ned! And I'll get busy on my silent motor."
</P>

<P>
"Getting busy" was Tom Swift's favorite occupation, and when he was
working on a new idea, as was the case now, he was seldom idle, night
or day.
</P>

<P>
"I have hardly seen you for two weeks," Mary Nestor wrote him one day.
"Aren't you ever coming to see me any more, or take me for a ride?"
</P>

<P>
"Yes," Tom wrote back. "I'll be over soon. And perhaps on the next ride
we take I won't have to shout at you through a speaking tube because
the motor makes so much noise."
</P>

<P>
From this it may be gathered that Tom was on the verge of success.
While not altogether satisfied with his progress, the young inventor
felt that he was on the right track. There were certain changes that
needed to be made in the apparatus he was building&mdash;certain refinements
that must be added, and when this should be done Tom was pretty certain
that he would have what would prove to be a very quiet aeroplane, if
not an absolutely silent one.
</P>

<P>
The young inventor was engaged one day with some of the last details of
the experiment. The new motor, with the silencer and the changed
cylinders, had been attached to one of Tom's speedy aeroplanes, and he
was making some intricate calculations in relation to a new cylinder
block, to be used when he started to make a completely new machine of
the improved type.
</P>

<P>
Tom had set down on paper some computations regarding the cross-section
of one of the cylinders, and was working out the amount of stress to
which he could subject a shoulder strut, when a shadow was cast across
the drawing board he had propped up in his lap.
</P>

<P>
In an instant Tom pulled a blank sheet over his mass of figures and
looked up, a sudden fear coming over him that another spy was at hand.
But a hearty voice reassured him.
</P>

<P>
"Bless my rice pudding!" cried Mr. Damon, "you shut yourself up here,
Tom, like a hermit in the mountains. Why don't you come out and enjoy
life?"
</P>

<P>
"Hello! Glad to see you!" cried Tom, joyfully. "You're just in time!"
</P>

<P>
"Time for what&mdash;dinner?" asked the eccentric man, with a chuckle. "If
so, my reference to rice pudding was very proper."
</P>

<P>
"Why, yes, I imagine there must be a dinner in prospect somewhere, Mr.
Damon," said Tom with a smile. "We'll have to see Mrs. Baggert about
that. But what I meant was that you're just in time to have a ride with
me, if you want to go."
</P>

<P>
"Go where?"
</P>

<P>
"Oh, up in cloudland. I have just finished my first sample of a silent
motor, and I'm going to try it this evening. Would you like to come
along?"
</P>

<P>
"I would!" exclaimed Mr. Damon. "Bless my onion soup, Tom, but I would!
But why fly at night? Isn't it safer by daylight?"
</P>

<P>
"Oh, that doesn't make much difference. It's safe enough at any time.
The reason I'm going to make my first flight after dark is that I don't
want any spies about."
</P>

<P>
"Oh, I see! Are they camping on your trail?"
</P>

<P>
"Not exactly. But I can't tell where they may be. If I should start out
in daylight and be forced to make a landing&mdash; Well, you know what a
crowd always collects to see a stranded airship."
</P>

<P>
"That's right, Tom."
</P>

<P>
"That decided me to start off after dark. Then if we have to come down
because of some sort of engine trouble or because my new attachment
doesn't work right, we sha'n't have any prying eyes."
</P>

<P>
"I see! Well, Tom, I'll go with you. Fortunately I didn't tell my wife
where I was going when I started out this afternoon, so she won't worry
until after it's over, and then it won't hurt her. I'm ready any time
you are."
</P>

<P>
"Good! Stay to dinner and I'll show you what I've made. Then we'll take
a flight after dark."
</P>

<P>
This suited the eccentric man, and a little later, after he had eaten
one of Mrs. Baggert's best meals, including rice pudding, of which he
was very fond, Mr. Damon accompanied Tom to one of the big hangars
where the new aeroplane had been set up.
</P>

<P>
"So that's the Air Scout, is it, Tom?" asked Mr. Damon, as he viewed
the machine.
</P>

<P>
"Yes, that's the girl. 'Air Scout' is as good a name as any, until I
see what she'll do."
</P>

<P>
"It doesn't look different from one of your regular craft of the skies,
Tom."
</P>

<P>
"No, she isn't. The main difference is here," and Tom showed his friend
where a peculiar apparatus had been attached to the motor. This was the
silencer&mdash;the whole secret of the invention, so to speak.
</P>

<P>
To Mr. Damon it seemed to consist of an amazing collection of pipes,
valves, baffle-plates, chambers, cylinders and reducers, which took the
hot exhaust gases as they came from the motor and "ate them up," as he
expressed it.
</P>

<P>
"The cylinders, too, and the spark plugs are differently arranged in
the motor itself, if you could see them," said Tom to his friend. "But
the main work of cutting down the noise is done right here," and he put
his hand on the steel case attached to the motor, the case containing
the apparatus already briefly described.
</P>

<P>
"Well, I'm ready when you are, Tom," said Mr. Damon.
</P>

<P>
"We'll go as soon as it's dark," was the reply. "But first I'll give
you a demonstration. Start the motor, Jackson!" Tom called to his chief
helper.
</P>

<P>
Mr. Damon had ridden in aeroplanes before, and had stood near when Tom
started them; so he was prepared for a great rush of air as the
propellers whirled about, and for deafening explosions from the engine.
</P>

<P>
The big blades, of new construction, were turned until the gas in the
cylinders was sufficiently compressed. Then Jackson stepped back out of
danger while Tom threw over the switch.
</P>

<P>
"Contact!" cried the young inventor.
</P>

<P>
Jackson gave the blades a quarter pull, and, a moment later, as he
leaped back out of the way, they began to revolve with the swiftness of
light. There was the familiar rush of air as the wooden wings cut
through the atmosphere, but there was scarcely any noise. Mr. Damon
could hardly believe his ears.
</P>

<P>
"I'm not running her at full speed," said Tom. "If I did she'd tear
loose from the holding blocks. But you can see what little racket she
makes."
</P>

<P>
"Bless my fountain pen!" cried Mr. Damon. "You are right, Tom Swift!
Why, I can hear you talk almost as easily as if no engine were going.
And I don't have to shout my head off, either."
</P>

<P>
This was perfectly true. Tom could converse with Mr. Damon in almost
ordinary tones. The exhaust from the motor was nearly completely
muffled.
</P>

<P>
"Out in the air it will seem even more quiet," said Tom. "I'll soon
give you a chance to verify that statement."
</P>

<P>
He ran the engine a little longer, the aeroplane quivering with the
vibrations, but remaining almost silent.
</P>

<P>
"I'm anxious to see what she'll do when in motion," said Tom, as he
shut off the gas and spark.
</P>

<P>
Soon after supper, when the shades of evening were falling, he and Mr.
Damon took their places in the first of the Air Scouts, to give it the
preliminary test in actual flying.
</P>

<P>
Would Tom's hopes be justified or would he be disappointed?

CHAPTER XII
</H3>

<H3 ALIGN="center">
THE CRY FOR HELP
</H3>

<P>
"All ready, Mr. Damon?" asked Tom, as he looked to see that all the
levers, wheels, valves, and other controls were in working order on his
Air Scout.
</P>

<P>
"As ready as I ever shall be, Tom," was the answer. "I don't know why
it is, but somehow I feel that something is going to happen on this
trip."
</P>

<P>
"Nonsense!" laughed Tom. "You're nervous; that's all."
</P>

<P>
"I suppose so. Don't think I'm going to back out, or anything like
that, but I wish it were successfully over with, Tom Swift, I most
certainly do."
</P>

<P>
"It will be in a little while," returned Tom, as he settled himself
comfortably in his seat and pulled the safety strap tight. "You've gone
up in this same plane before, when it didn't have the silent motor
aboard."
</P>

<P>
"Yes, I know I have. Oh, I dare say it will be all right, Tom.  And
yet, somehow, I can't help feeling&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
But Tom Swift felt that the best way to set Mr. Damon's premonitions to
rest was to start the motor, and this he gave orders to have done,
Jackson and some others of the men from the shops congregating about
the craft to see the beginning of the night flight. Mr. Swift was there
also, and Eradicate. Mary Nestor had been invited, but her Red Cross
work engaged her that evening, she said. Ned Newton was away from town
on Liberty Bond business, and he could not be present at the test.
</P>

<P>
However, as Tom expected to have other trials when his motor was in
even better shape, he was not exactly sorry for the absence of his
friends.
</P>

<P>
"Contact!" called the young inventor, when Jackson had stepped back,
indicating it was time to throw over the switch.
</P>

<P>
"Let her go!" cried Tom, and the next moment the motor was in
operation, but so silently that his voice and that of Mr. Damon's could
easily be heard above the machinery.
</P>

<P>
"Good, Tom! That's good!" cried Mr. Swift, and Tom easily heard his
father's voice, though under other, and ordinary, circumstances this
would have been impossible.
</P>

<P>
True, the hearing of Tom and Mr. Damon was muffled to a certain extent
by the heavy leather and fur-lined caps they wore. But Tom had several
small eyelet holes set into the flaps just over the opening of the
ears, and these holes were sufficient to admit sounds, while keeping
out most of the cold that obtains in the upper regions.
</P>

<P>
The aeroplane moved swiftly along the level starting ground, and away
from the lighted hangars. Faster and faster it swung along as Tom
headed it into the wind, and then, as the speed of the motor increased,
the Air Scout suddenly left the earth and went soaring aloft as she had
done before.
</P>

<P>
But there was this difference. She moved almost as silently as a great
owl which swoops down out of the darkness&mdash;a bit of the velvety
blackness itself. Up and up, and onward and onward, went the Air Scout.
Tom Swift's improved, silent motor urged it onward, and as the young
inventor listened to catch the noise of the machinery, his heart gave a
bound of hope. For he could detect only very slight sounds.
</P>

<P>
"She's a success!" exulted Tom to himself. "She's a success, but she
isn't perfect yet," he added. "I've got to make the muffler bigger and
put in more baffle-plates. Then I think I can turn the trick."
</P>

<P>
He swung the machine out over the open country, and then, when they
were up at a height and sailing along easily, he called back to Mr.
Damon in the seat behind him:
</P>

<P>
"How do you like it?"
</P>

<P>
"Great!" exclaimed the eccentric man. "Bless my postage stamp, but it's
great! Why, there's hardly a sound, Tom, and I can hear you quite
easily."
</P>

<P>
"And I can hear you," added Tom. "I don't believe, down below there,"
and he nodded toward the earth, though Mr. Damon could not see this, as
the airship, save for a tiny light over the instrument board, was in
darkness, "they know that we're flying over their heads."
</P>

<P>
"I agree with you," was the answer. "Tom, my boy, I believe you've
solved the trick! You have produced a silent aeroplane, and now it's up
to the government to make use of it."
</P>

<P>
"I'm not quite ready for that yet," replied the young inventor.  "I
have several improvements to make. But, when they are finished, I'll
let Uncle Sam know what I have. Then it's up to him."
</P>

<P>
"And you must be careful, Tom, that some of your rivals don't hear of
your success and get it away from you," warned Mr. Damon, as Tom guided
the Air Scout along the aerial way&mdash;an unlighted and limitless path in
the silent darkness.
</P>

<P>
"Oh, they'll have to get up pretty early in the morning to do that!"
boasted Tom, and afterward he was to recall those words with a bit of
chagrin.
</P>

<P>
On and on they sailed, and as Tom increased the speed of the motor, and
noted how silently it ran, he began to have high hopes that he had
builded better than he knew. For even with the motor running at almost
full speed there was not noise enough to hinder talk between himself
and Mr. Damon.
</P>

<P>
Of course there was some little sound. Even the most perfect electric
motor has a sort of hum which can be detected when one is close to it.
But at a little distance a great dynamo in operation appears to be
silence itself.
</P>

<P>
"I can go this one better, though," said Tom as he sailed along in the
night. "I see where I've made a few mistakes in the baffle plate of the
silencer. I'll correct that and&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
As he spoke the machine gave a lurch, and the motor, instead of
remaining silent, began to cough and splutter as in the former days.
</P>

<P>
"Bless my rubber boots, Tom! what's the matter?" cried Mr. Damon.
</P>

<P>
"Something's gone wrong," Tom answered, barely able to hear and make
himself heard above the sudden noise. "I'll have to shut off the power
and glide down. We can make a landing in this big field," for just then
the moon came out from behind a cloud, and Tom saw, below them, a great
meadow, not far from the home of Mary Nestor. He had often landed in
this same place.
</P>

<P>
"Something has broken in the muffler, I think, letting out some of the
exhaust," he said to Mr. Damon, for, now that the motor was shut off,
Tom could speak in his ordinary tones. "I'll soon have it fixed, or, if
I can't, we can go back in the old style&mdash;with the machine making as
much racket as it pleases."
</P>

<P>
So Tom guided the machine down. It went silently now, of course,
making, with the motor shut off, no more sound than a falling leaf.
Down to the soft, springy turf in the green meadow Tom guided the
machine. As it came to a stop, and he and Mr. Damon got out, there was
borne to their ears a wild cry:
</P>

<P>
"Help! Help!"
</P>

<BR><BR><BR>

<A NAME="chap13"></A>
<H3 ALIGN="center">
CHAPTER XIII
</H3>

<H3 ALIGN="center">
SOMETHING QUEER
</H3>

<P>
"Did you hear that?" asked Tom Swift of his companion.
</P>

<P>
"Hear it? Bless my ear drums, I should say I did hear it! Some one is
in trouble, Tom. Caught in a bog, most likely, the same as that spy
chap who was at your place. That's it&mdash;caught in a bog!"
</P>

<P>
"There isn't any bog or swamp around here, Mr. Damon. If there was I
shouldn't have tried a landing. No, it's something else besides that.
Hark!"
</P>

<P>
Again the cry sounded, seeming to come from a point behind the landing
place of the silent airship. It was clear and distinct:
</P>

<P>
"Help! Help! They are&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
The voice seemed to die away in a gurgle, as though the person's mouth
had been covered quickly.
</P>

<P>
"He's sinking, Tom! He's sinking!" cried Mr. Damon. "I once heard a man
who almost drowned cry out, and it sounded exactly like that!"
</P>

<P>
"But there isn't any water around here for any one to drown in,"
declared Tom. "It's a big, dry meadow. I know where we are."
</P>

<P>
"Then what is it?"
</P>

<P>
"I don't know, but we're going to find out. Some one attacked by some
one else&mdash;or something, I should say," ventured the young inventor.
</P>

<P>
"Something! do you mean a wild beast, Tom?"
</P>

<P>
"No, for there aren't any of those here any more than there is water.
Though it may be that some farmer's bull or a savage dog has got loose
and has attacked some traveler. But, in that case I think we would hear
bellows or barks, and all I heard was a cry for help."
</P>

<P>
"The same with me, Tom. Let's investigate;"
</P>

<P>
"That's what I intend doing. Come on. The airship will be all right
until we come back."
</P>

<P>
"Better take a light&mdash;hadn't you? It's dark, even if the moon does show
now and then," suggested Mr. Damon.
</P>

<P>
"Guess you are right," agreed Tom. Aboard his airship there were
several small but powerful portable electric lights, and after securing
one of these Tom and Mr. Damon started for the spot whence the call for
help had come. As they walked along, their feet making no noise on the
soft turf, they listened intently for a repetition of the call for aid.
</P>

<P>
"I don't hear anything," said Tom, after a bit.
</P>

<P>
"Nor I," added Mr. Damon. "We don't know exactly which way to go, Tom."
</P>

<P>
"That's right. Guess we'd better give him a hail; whoever it is."
</P>

<P>
Tom came to a halt, and raising his voice to a shout called:
</P>

<P>
"Hello there! What's the matter? We'll help you if you can tell us
which way to come!"
</P>

<P>
They both listened intently, but no voice answered them. At the same
time, however, they were aware of a sound as of hurrying feet, and
there seemed to be muttered imprecations not far away.  Tom and Mr.
Damon looked in the direction of the sound, and the young inventor
flashed his light. But there was a clump of bushes and trees at that
point and the electrical rays did not penetrate very far.
</P>

<P>
"Some one's over there!" exclaimed Tom in a whisper. "We'd better go
and see what it is."
</P>

<P>
"All right," agreed Mr. Damon, and he, too, spoke in a low voice.
</P>

<P>
Why they did this when their previous talk had been in ordinary tones,
and when Tom had shouted so loudly, they did not stop to reason about
or explain just then. But later they both admitted that they whispered
because they thought there was something wrong on foot&mdash;because they
feared a crime was being committed and they wanted to surprise the
perpetrators if they could.
</P>

<P>
And it was this fact of their whispering that enabled the two to hear
something that, otherwise, they might not have heard. And this was the
sound of some vehicle hurrying away&mdash;an automobile, if Tom was any
judge. The cries for help had been succeeded by stifled vocal sounds,
and these, in turn, by the noise of wheels on the ground.
</P>

<P>
"What does it all mean?" asked Mr. Damon in a whisper.
</P>

<P>
"I don't know," answered Tom, resolutely, "but we've got to find out.
Come on."
</P>

<P>
They advanced toward the dark clump of trees and low bushes.  There was
no need to be especially cautious in regard to being silent, as their
feet made little, if any, sound on the deep grass. And, as Tom walked
in advance, now and then flashing his light, Mr. Damon suddenly caught
him by the coat.
</P>

<P>
"What is it?" asked the young inventor.
</P>

<P>
"Look! Just over the top of that hill, where the moon shines.  Don't
you see an automobile outlined?"
</P>

<P>
Tom looked quickly.
</P>

<P>
"I do," he answered. "There's a road from here, just the other side of
those trees, to that hill. The auto must have gone that way. Well,
there's no use in trying to follow it now. Whoever it was has gotten
away."
</P>

<P>
"But they may have left some one behind, Tom. We'd better look in and
around those trees."
</P>

<P>
"I suppose we had, but I don't believe we'll find anything. I can
pretty nearly guess, now, what it was."
</P>

<P>
"What?" asked Mr. Damon.
</P>

<P>
"Well, some chauffeur was out for a ride in his employer's car without
permission. He got here, had an accident&mdash;maybe some friends he took
for a ride were hurt and they called for help.  The chauffeur knew if
there was any publicity he'd be blamed, and so he got away as quickly
as he could. Guess the accident&mdash;if that's what it was&mdash;didn't amount
to much, or they couldn't have run the car off. We've had our trouble
for our pains."
</P>

<P>
"Well, maybe you're right, Tom Swift, but all the same, I'd like to
have a look among those trees," said Mr. Damon.
</P>

<P>
"Oh. we'll look, all right," assented Tom, "but I doubt if we find
anything."
</P>

<P>
And he was right. They walked in and about the little grove, flashing
the light at intervals, but beyond marks of auto wheels in the dust of
the road, which was near the clump of maples, there was nothing to
indicate what had happened.
</P>

<P>
"Though there was some sort of fracas," declared Tom. "Look where the
dust is trampled down. There were several men here, perhaps skylarking,
or perhaps it was a fight."
</P>

<P>
"Some one must have been hurt, or they wouldn't have cried for help,"
said Mr. Damon.
</P>

<P>
"Well, that's so. But perhaps it was some one not used to riding in
autos, and he may have imagined the accident was worse than it was, and
called for help involuntarily. There is no evidence of any serious
accident having happened&mdash;no spots of blood, at any rate," and Tom
laughed at his own grimness. "It was a new car, too, or at least one
with new tires on."
</P>

<P>
"How do you know?" asked Mr. Damon.
</P>

<P>
"Tell by the plain marks of the rubber tread in the dust," was the
answer. "Look," and Tom pointed to the wheel marks in the focus of his
electric lamp. "It's a new tire, too, with square protuberances on the
tread instead of the usual diamond or round ones. A new kind of tire,
all right."
</P>

<P>
He and Mr. Damon remained for a few minutes looking about the place
whence had come the calls for help, and then the eccentric man remarked:
</P>

<P>
"Well, as long as we can't do anything here, Tom, we might as well
travel on; what do you say?"
</P>

<P>
"I agree with you. There isn't any use in staying. We'll get the Air
Scout fixed up and travel back home. But this was something queer,"
mused Tom. "I hope it doesn't turn out later that a crime has been
committed, and we didn't show enough gumption to prevent it."
</P>

<P>
"We couldn't prevent it. We heard the cries as soon as we landed."
</P>

<P>
"Yes, but if we had rushed over at once we might have caught the
fellows. But I guess it was only a slight accident, and some one was
more frightened than hurt. We'll have to let it go at that."
</P>

<P>
But the more he thought about it the more Tom Swift thought there was
something queer in that weird cry for help on the lonely meadow in the
darkness of the night.
</P>

<A NAME="chap14"></A>
<H3 ALIGN="center">
CHAPTER XIV
</H3>

<H3 ALIGN="center">
THE TELEPHONE CALL
</H3>

<P>
The defect in the motor which had caused Tom Swift to shut off the
power and drift down to earth was soon remedied, once the young
inventor began an examination of the craft. One of the oil feeds had
become choked and this automatically cut down the gasoline supply,
causing one or more cylinders to miss. It was a safety device Tom had
installed to prevent the motor running dry, and so being damaged.
</P>

<P>
Once the clogged oil feed was cleared the motor ran as before, and just
as silently, though, as Tom had said, he was not entirely satisfied
with the quietness, but intended to do further work toward perfecting
it.
</P>

<P>
"I'll start the propellers now, Mr. Damon," said Tom, when the trouble
had been remedied. "You know how to throw the switch, don't you?"
</P>

<P>
"I guess so," was the answer. Mr. Damon and Tom had traveled so often
together in gasoline craft that the young inventor had taught his
friend certain fundamentals about them, and in an emergency the
eccentric man could help start an aeroplane. This he now did, taking
charge of the controls which could be operated from his seat as well as
from Tom's. Tom whirled the propellers, and soon the motor was in
motion.
</P>

<P>
Mr. Damon, once the big wooden blades were revolving, slowed down the
apparatus until Tom could jump aboard, after which the latter took
charge and soon speeded up the machine, sending it aloft.
</P>

<P>
As the green meadow, dimly seen in the light of the moon, seemed to
drop away below them, and the clump of trees vanished from sight, both
Tom and Mr. Damon wondered who it was that had called for help, and if
the matter were at all serious. They were inclined to think it was not,
but Tom could not rid himself of a faint suspicion that there might
have been trouble.
</P>

<P>
However, thoughts of his new silent Air Scout soon drove everything
else from his mind, and as he guided the comparatively silent machine
on its quiet way toward his own home he was thinking how he could best
improve the muffler.
</P>

<P>
"Well, here we are again, safe and sound," remarked Tom, as he brought
the craft to a stop in front of the hangar, and Jackson and his
helpers, who were awaiting the return, hurried out to take charge.
</P>

<P>
"Yes, everything seems to point to success, Tom," agreed Mr. Damon.
"That is, unless the slight accident we had means trouble."
</P>

<P>
"Oh, no, that had nothing to do with the operation of the silencer. But
I'm going to do better yet. Some day I'll take you for a ride in a
silent machine which will make so little noise that you can hear a pin
drop."
</P>

<P>
"Well," remarked Mr. Damon' with a laugh, "I don't know that listening
to falling pins will give me any great amount of pleasure, Tom, but I
appreciate your meaning."
</P>

<P>
"Everything all right?" asked Mr. Swift, as he came out to hear the
details from his son. "Do you think you have solved the problem?"
</P>

<P>
"Not completely, but I'll soon be able to write Q. E. D. after it. Some
refinements are all that are needed, Dad."
</P>

<P>
"Glad to hear it. I was a bit anxious."
</P>

<P>
Mr. Swift questioned his son about the technical details of the trip,
asking how the motor had acted under the pressure caused by so
completely muffling the exhaust, and for some minutes the two
inventors, young and old, indulged in talk which was not at all
interesting to Mr. Damon. They went into the house, and Tom asked to
have a little lunch, which Mrs. Baggert set out for him.
</P>

<P>
"It's rather late to eat," said the young inventor, "but I always feel
hungry after I test a new machine and find that it works pretty well.
Will you join me in a sandwich or two, Mr. Damon?"
</P>

<P>
"Why, bless my ketchup bottle, I believe I will."
</P>

<P>
And so they ate and talked. Tom was on the point of telling his father
something of the queer cry for help they had heard on the lonely meadow
when Mrs. Baggert produced a letter which she said had come for Tom
that afternoon, but had been mislaid by a new maid who had been engaged
to help with the housework.
</P>

<P>
"She took it to the shop after you had left, and only now told me about
it," explained Mrs. Baggert. "So I sent Eradicate for it."
</P>

<P>
"How long ago was that?" asked Tom, as he took the missive.
</P>

<P>
"Oh, an hour ago," answered Mrs. Baggert, with a smile. "But don't
blame poor Rad for that. He wanted to deliver the letter to you
personally, and so did Koku. The result was your giant kept after Rad,
trying to get the letter from him, and Rad kept hiding and slinking
about for a chance to see you himself until I saw what was going on, a
little while ago, and took the letter myself. Else you might never have
gotten it, so jealous are those two," and Mrs. Baggert laughed.
</P>

<P>
"Guess it isn't of much importance," Tom said, as he tore open the
envelope. "It's from the Universal Flying Machine Company, of New York,
and I imagine they're trying to get me to reconsider my refusal to link
up with them."
</P>

<P>
"Yes," he went on, as he read the missive, "that's it. They've raised
the amount to thirty thousand a year now, Dad, and they say they feel
sure I shall regret it if I do not accept.
</P>

<P>
"This is a bit queer, though," went on the young inventor.  "This
letter was written three days ago, but it reached Shopton only to-day.
And it says that unless they hear from me at once they will have to
take steps that will cause me great inconvenience. They have nerve, at
any rate, and impudence, too!  I won't even bother to answer. But I
wonder what they mean, and why this letter was delayed?"
</P>

<P>
"The mails are all late on account of the transportation congestion
caused by moving troops to the camps," said Mr. Damon.  "Some of my
letters are delayed a week. But, as you say, Tom, these fellows are
very impudent to threaten that way."
</P>

<P>
"It's all bluff," declared Tom. "I'm not worrying. And now, Dad, since
I've almost reached the top of the hill with my Air Scout, I may be
able to help you on that new electric motor you're puzzling over."
</P>

<P>
"I wish you would, Tom. I am trying to invent a new system of
interchangeable brush contacts, but so far I've been unable to make
them work. However, there is no great hurry about that. If you are
going to offer your silent machine to the government finish that first.
We need all the aircraft we can get. The battles on the other side seem
to be all in favor of the Germans, so far."
</P>

<P>
"We haven't got into our stride yet," declared Mr. Damon. "Once Uncle
Sam gets the boys over there in force, there'll be a different story to
tell. I only wish&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
At that moment the telephone set up an insistent ringing, breaking in
on Mr. Damon's remarks.
</P>

<P>
"I'll answer," said Tom, as Mrs. Baggert moved toward the instrument,
which was an extension from the main one.
</P>

<P>
"Hello!" called the young inventor into the transmitter, and as he
received an answer a look of pleasure came over his face.
</P>

<P>
"Yes, Mary, this is Tom," he said. He remained silent a moment, while
it was evident he was listening to the voice at the other end of the
wire. Then he suddenly exclaimed:
</P>

<P>
"What's that? Tell him to come home? Why, he isn't here. I just came in
and&mdash;what&mdash;wait a minute!"
</P>

<P>
With a rather strange look on his face Tom covered the mouth-piece of
the instrument with his hand, and, turning to his father, asked:
</P>

<P>
"Is Mr. Nestor here?"
</P>

<P>
"No," replied Mr. Swift slowly, "He was here, though. He came a little
while after you and Mr. Damon started off in the Air Scout. But he
didn't stay. Said he wanted to see you about something and would call
again."
</P>

<P>
"Oh," remarked the young man. "I didn't know he had been there."
</P>

<P>
"I meant to tell you," said Mrs. Baggert; "but getting the lunch made
me forget it, I guess."
</P>

<P>
Tom uncovered the transmitter of the telephone again, and spoke to Mary
Nestor.
</P>

<P>
"Hello," he said. "I was wrong, Mary. Your father was here, but he left
when he found I wasn't at home. How long ago? Wait a minute and I'll
inquire.
</P>

<P>
"How long ago did Mr. Nestor leave?" asked the young inventor of the
housekeeper. "Nearly an hour," he said into the instrument, after he
had received the answer. Then, after listening a moment, he added:
"Yes, I guess he'll be home soon now. Probably stopped down town to see
some of his friends. Yes, Mr. Damon and I tried out the Air Scout. Yes,
she worked pretty well, for a starter, but there is something yet to be
done. Oh, yes, now I'll have time to come over to see you, and take you
for a ride too. We won't have to talk through a speaking tube, either.
Tell your father I am sorry I was out when he called.  I'll come to see
him to-morrow, if he wants me to. Yes&mdash;yes. I guess so!" and Tom
laughed, it being evident that his remarks at the end of the
conversation had to do with personal matters.
</P>

<P>
"A telegram has come for Mr. Nestor and they were anxious that he
should get it," Tom explained to his little audience as he hung up the
receiver and put aside the telephone. "I wonder what he wanted to see
me about?"
</P>

<P>
"He didn't say," replied Mrs. Baggert.
</P>

<P>
Mr. Damon, Tom, and his father remained in conversation a little while
longer, and the eccentric man was thinking that it was about time for
him to return home, when the telephone rang again.
</P>

<P>
"Hello," answered Tom, as he was nearest the instrument. "Oh, yes,
Mary, this is he. What's that? Your father hasn't reached home yet? And
your mother is worried? Oh tell her there is no cause for alarm. As I
said, he probably stopped on his way to see some friends."
</P>

<P>
Tom listened for perhaps half a minute to a talk that was inaudible to
the others in the room, and they noticed a grave look come over his
face. Then he said:
</P>

<P>
"I'll be right over, Mary. Yes, I'll come at once. And tell your mother
not to worry. I'm sure nothing could have happened.  I'll be with you
in a jiffy!"
</P>

<P>
As Tom Swift hung up the receiver he said:
</P>

<P>
"Mr. Nestor hasn't reached home yet, and as he promised to return at
once in case he didn't find me, his wife is much worried. I'll go over
and see what I can do."
</P>

<P>
"I'll come along!" volunteered Mr. Damon. "It isn't late yet."
</P>

<P>
"Yes, do come," urged Tom. "But I suppose when we get there we'll find
our friend has arrived safely. We'll go over in the electric runabout."
</P>

CHAPTER XV
</H3>

<H3 ALIGN="center">
A VAIN SEARCH
</H3>

<P>
Tom Swift's speedy little electric car was soon at the door in
readiness to take him and Mr. Damon to the Nestor home. The electric
runabout was a machine Tom had evolved in his early inventive days, and
though he had other automobiles, none was quite so fast or so simple to
run as this, which well merited the name of the most rapid machine on
the road. In it Tom had once won a great race, as has been related in
the book bearing the title, "Tom Swift and His Electric Runabout."
</P>

<P>
"Mary didn't telephone again, did she?" Tom asked his father, as he
stopped at the house to get Mr. Damon, having gone out to see about
getting the electric runabout in readiness.
</P>

<P>
"No," was the answer. "The telephone hasn't rung since."
</P>

<P>
"Then, I guess, Mr. Nestor can't have arrived home," said Tom.  "It's a
bit queer, his delay, but I'm sure it will be explained naturally. Only
Mary and her mother are alone and, very likely, they're nervous. I'll
telephone to let you know everything is all right as soon as I get
there," Tom promised his father and Mrs. Baggert as he drove off down
the road, partly illuminated by the new moon.
</P>

<P>
Rapidly and almost as silently as his Air Scout Tom Swift drove the
speedy car down the highway. It was about three miles from his home to
that of Mary Nestor, and though the distance was quickly covered, to
Tom, at least, the space seemed interminable.  But at length he drove
up to the door. There were lights in most of the rooms, which was
unusual at this time of night.
</P>

<P>
The sound of the wheels had not ceased echoing on the gravel of the
drive before Mary was out on the porch, which she illuminated by an
overhead light.
</P>

<P>
"Oh, Tom," she cried, "he hasn't come yet, and we are so worried! Did
you see anything of father as you came along?"
</P>

<P>
"No," was Tom's answer. "But we didn't look for him along the road, as
we came by the turnpike, and he wouldn't travel that way. But he will
be along at any moment now. You must remember it's quite a walk from my
house, and&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
"But he was on his bicycle," said Mary. "We wanted him to go in the
auto, but he said he wanted some exercise after supper, and he went
over on his wheel. He said he'd be right back, but he hasn't come yet."
</P>

<P>
"Oh, he will!" said Tom reassuringly. "He may have had a puncture, or
something like that. Bicyclists are just as liable to them as
autoists," he added with a laugh.
</P>

<P>
"Well, I'm sure I hope it will be all right," sighed Mary. "I wish you
could convince mother to that effect. She's as nervous as a cat. Come
in and tell us what to do."
</P>

<P>
"Oh, he'll be all right," declared Mr. Damon, adding his assurances to
Tom's.
</P>

<P>
They found Mrs. Nestor verging on an attack of hysteria. Though Mr.
Nestor often went out during the evening, he seldom stayed late.
</P>

<P>
"And he said he'd be right back if he found you weren't at home, Tom,"
said Mrs. Nestor. "I'm sure I don't know what can be keeping him!"
</P>

<P>
"It's too soon to get worried yet," replied the young inventor
cheerfully. "I'll wait a little while, and then, if he doesn't come,
Mr. Damon and I will go back over the road and look carefully. He may
have had a slight fall&mdash;sprained his ankle or something like that&mdash;and
not be able to ride. We came by the turnpike, a road he probably
wouldn't take on his wheel. He's all right, you may be sure of that."
</P>

<P>
Tom tried to speak reassuringly, but somehow, he did not believe
himself. He was beginning to think more and more how strange it was
that Mr. Nestor did not return home.
</P>

<P>
"We'll wait just a bit longer before setting out on a search," he told
Mary and her mother. "But I'm sure he will be along any minute now."
</P>

<P>
They went into the library, Mary and her mother, Tom and Mr. Damon. And
there they sat waiting. Tom tried to entertain Mary and Mrs. Nestor
with an account of his trial trip in the Air Scout, but the two women
scarcely heard what he said.
</P>

<P>
All sat watching the clock, and looking from that to the telephone,
which they tried to hope would ring momentarily and transmit to them
good news. Then they would listen for the sound of footsteps or bicycle
wheels on the gravel walk. But they heard nothing, and as the seconds
were ticked off on the clock the nervousness of Mrs. Nestor increased,
until she exclaimed:
</P>

<P>
"I can stand it no longer! We must notify the police&mdash;or do something!"
</P>

<P>
"I wouldn't notify the police just yet," counseled Tom. "Mr. Damon and
I will start out and look along the road. If it should happen, as will
probably turn out to be the case, that Mr. Nestor has met with only a
simple accident, he would not like the notoriety, or publicity, of
having the police notified."
</P>

<P>
"No, I am sure he would not," agreed Mary. "Tom's way is best, Mother."
</P>

<P>
"All right, just as you say, only find my husband," and Mrs. Nestor
sighed, and turned her head away.
</P>

<P>
"Even if Mr. Nestor had had a fall," reasoned Tom, "he could call for
help, and get some one to telephone, unless&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
And as he reasoned thus Tom Swift gave a mental start at his own use of
the word "help."
</P>

<P>
That weird cry on the lonely meadow came back to him with startling
distinctness.
</P>

<P>
"Come on, Mr. Damon!" cried Tom, in a voice he tried to make cheerful.
"We'll find that Mr. Nestor is probably walking along, carrying his
disabled bicycle instead of having it carry him.  We'll soon have him
safe back to you," he called to the two women.
</P>

<P>
"I wish I could go with you, and help search," observed Mary.
</P>

<P>
"Oh, I couldn't bear to be left alone!" exclaimed her mother.
</P>

<P>
"We'll telephone as soon as we find him," called Tom to Mrs. Nestor, as
he and Mr. Damon again got into the runabout and started away from the
place.
</P>

<P>
"What do you think of it, Tom?" asked the eccentric man, when they were
once more on the road.
</P>

<P>
"Why, nothing much&mdash;as yet," Tom said. "That is, I think nothing more
than a simple accident has happened, if, indeed, it is anything more
than that he has delayed to talk to some friends."
</P>

<P>
"Would he delay this long?"
</P>

<P>
"I don't know."
</P>

<P>
"And then, Tom&mdash;bless my spectacles! what of that cry we heard?  Could
that have been Mr. Nestor?"
</P>

<P>
There! It was out! The suspicion that Tom had been trying to keep his
mind away from came to the fore. Well, he might as well race the issue
now as later.
</P>

<P>
"I've been thinking of that," he told Mr. Damon. "It might have been
Mary's father calling for help."
</P>

<P>
"But we looked, Tom, near the trees, and couldn't discover anything. If
he had been calling for help&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
Mr. Damon did not finish.
</P>

<P>
"He may have fallen from his wheel and been hurt," said Tom, as he
turned the electric runabout into the highway that Mr. Nestor would,
most likely, have taken on his way from Shopton. "Then he may have
called for help, and some autoists, passing, may have heard and taken
him away."
</P>

<P>
"Yes, but where, Tom? Whoever called for help was taken away, that's
sure. But where?"
</P>

<P>
"To some hospital, I suppose."
</P>

<P>
"Then hadn't we better inquire there? There are only two hospitals of
any account around here. The one in Shopton and the one in Waterfield.
My wife is on the board of Lady Managers there. We could call that
hospital up and&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
"We'll look along the road first," said Tom. "If we begin to make
inquiries at the hospitals there will be a lot of questions asked, and
a general alarm may be sent out. Mr. Nestor wouldn't like that, if he
isn't in any danger. And it may turn out that he has met an old friend,
and has been talking with him all this while, forgetting all about the
passage of time."
</P>

<P>
They were now driving along the highway that led from the little suburb
where Mr. Nestor lived, to the main part of Shopton, just beyond which
was Tom's home. This section was country-like, with very few houses and
those placed at rather infrequent intervals. The road was a good one,
though not the main-traveled one, and Mr. Nestor, as was known,
frequently used it when he rode his bicycle, an exercise of which he
was very fond.
</P>

<P>
As Tom and Mr. Damon drove along, they scanned, as best they could in
the light from the young moon and the powerful lamps on the runabout,
every part of the highway. They were looking for some dark blot which
might indicate where a man had fallen from his wheel and was lying in
some huddled heap on the road. But they saw nothing like this, much to
their relief.
</P>

<P>
"Do you know, Tom," said Mr. Damon, when they were nearing the town,
and their search, thus far, had been in vain, "I think we're going at
this the wrong way."
</P>

<P>
"Why, so?"
</P>

<P>
"Because Mr. Nestor may have fallen, and been hurt, and have been
carried into any one of a dozen houses along the road. In that case we
wouldn't see him. We've passed over the most lonely part of the journey
and haven't seen him. If the accident occurred near the houses his
cries would have brought some one out to help him. He is well known
around here, and, even if he were unconscious and couldn't tell who he
was, he could be identified by papers in his pockets. Then his family
would be notified by telephone."
</P>

<P>
"Perhaps you are right, Mr. Damon. We may be wasting time this way.
What do you suggest?" asked Tom.
</P>

<P>
"That we don't delay any longer, but call up the hospitals at once. If
he isn't in either of those he must be in some house, and in such
condition that his identity cannot be established. In that event it is
a case for the police. We haven't found him, and I think we had better
give the alarm."
</P>

<P>
Tom Swift thought it over for a moment. Then he came to a sudden
decision.
</P>

<P>
"You're right!" he told Mr. Damon. "We mustn't waste any more time. He
isn't along the road he ought to have traveled in coming from my house
to his home&mdash;that's sure. But before I call up the hospitals I want to
try out one more idea."
</P>

<P>
"What's that, Tom?"
</P>

<P>
"I want to go to the place where we heard that cry for help."
</P>

<P>
"Do you think that could have been Mr. Nestor?"
</P>

<P>
"It may have been. We'll go and take another look around there.  Some
man was evidently hurt there, and was taken away. We may get a clew.
The lights on the runabout will give us a better chance to look around
than we had by the little pocket lamp. We'll try there, and, if we
don't find anything, then I'll call up the hospitals."
</P>

<H3 ALIGN="center">
CHAPTER XVI
</H3>

<H3 ALIGN="center">
THE LONG NIGHT
</H3>

<P>
With the speedy runabout it did not take Tom Swift and Mr. Damon long
to reach the place where the Air Scout had been grounded a few hours
before, and where they had heard the cry for help. All was as dark and
as silent as when they had been there before.
</P>

<P>
But, as Tom had said, the lights from his electric runabout would give
a brilliant illumination, and these he now directed toward the clump of
trees whence the cry for help had seemed to come.
</P>

<P>
"Doesn't appear to have been visited by any one since we were here,"
remarked Tom, as he observed the marks of the new automobile tire in
the dust. "Now we'll look about more carefully."
</P>

<P>
This they did, but they were about to give up in despair and start for
the nearest telephone to call up the hospitals, when Mr. Damon gave an
exclamation.
</P>

<P>
"What is it?" asked Tom.
</P>

<P>
"Something bright and shining!" said his companion. "I saw it gleam in
the light of the lamps. You nearly put your foot on it, Tom. Just step
back a moment."
</P>

<P>
Tom did so, and the eccentric man, with another exclamation, this time
of satisfaction, reached down and picked something up from the dusty
road.
</P>

<P>
"It's a watch!" he exclaimed. "A gold watch! And it's been stepped on,
evidently, or run over by an auto. Not much damaged, but the case is a
bit bent and scratched. It's stopped, too!" he added as he held it to
his ear.
</P>

<P>
"What time does it show?" asked Tom.
</P>

<P>
"Eight forty-seven," answered Mr. Damon, as he consulted the dial.
"Why, Tom, that was just about when we heard the cries for help!"
</P>

<P>
"Yes, it must have been. Let me see that watch."
</P>

<P>
No sooner had the young inventor taken the timepiece into his hands
than he, too, uttered a cry of amazement.
</P>

<P>
"Do you recognize it?" asked Mr. Damon, in great excitement.
</P>

<P>
"It's Mr. Nestor's watch!" cried Tom. "He must have fallen here, and
been hurt. It was Mr. Nestor who cried for help, and who was taken away
by the autoists. They've probably taken him to some hospital. There's
been an accident all right."
</P>

<P>
Tom and Mr. Damon were of one mind now in thinking that Mr. Nestor had
met with some mishap on the road&mdash;an automobile accident most
likely&mdash;and that he was the person who had called for help.
</P>

<P>
"If they had only answered when we hallooed at them," said Tom, "we
wouldn't be in all this stew now. We could have told the strangers who
came to his aid who he was, and we might even have taken him to the
hospital in the airship."
</P>

<P>
"Well, it's too late to think of that now," returned Mr. Damon.  "We
had better get into communication with him as soon as we can, and then
send word to his wife and daughter. I hope he isn't badly hurt."
</P>

<P>
Tom hoped so, too, with all his heart.
</P>

<P>
There was nothing to do but to get back in the runabout and make all
speed for the nearest telephone, and Tom Swift lost little time in
doing this. They found a drug store which was open a little later than
usual, and at once Tom went into the booth and called up the Shopton
hospital. He was well known there, as he and his father were liberal
supporters of the institution, which was a private affair. Many of
Tom's men were treated at the dispensary, and, as accidents were of
more or less frequent occurrence at the works, the young inventor had
frequent occasions to call up the place.
</P>

<P>
"Mr. Nestor would ask to be taken there, as it's nearest his home&mdash;that
is, if he was able to speak," Tom said to Mr. Damon, who agreed with
him. There was a little delay in getting the hospital on the wire, but
when Tom had it, and was talking to the superintendent, he was rather
surprised, to tell the truth, to be told that Mr. Nestor had not been
brought in.
</P>

<P>
"We haven't had any accident cases all day, nor to-night, Mr. Swift,"
the superintendent reported. "Was this some one special you were
inquiring about?"
</P>

<P>
For Tom, determining not to give Mr. Nestor's name, except as a last
resort, had merely inquired whether any recent accident cases had been
brought in.
</P>

<P>
"I'll let you know later, Mr. Millard," he told the superintendent, not
exactly answering the question. He hung up the receiver, and, opening
the door of the booth, said to Mr. Damon: "He isn't there."
</P>

<P>
"Then try Waterfield," was the suggestion; and Tom did so, though he
could not imagine why an injured man, such as Mr. Nestor might prove to
be, should be taken as far as Waterfield, when the hospital at Shopton
was nearer.
</P>

<P>
"Unless," he told Mr. Damon, "the people which ran down Mary's father
didn't know about our hospital."
</P>

<P>
The reply from the institution in Mr. Damon's home town was just as
discouraging as had been the answer from Shopton. At first, when Tom
inquired, the head nurse had said there was an accident case at that
moment being brought in. Tom was all excitement until she went to
inquire the name and circumstances, and then he learned that it was the
case of a little boy who had fallen downstairs at his home and broken a
leg. There was no record of any one answering the description of Mr.
Nestor having been brought in that evening.
</P>

<P>
"Hum! This is getting to be mysterious," mused Tom, as he came out of
the booth. "What shall we do&mdash;go back and tell Mrs. Nestor and Mary, or
communicate with the police?"
</P>

<P>
"Why not try the Alexian Hospital?" asked Mr. Damon. "That's away over
in Centerford, to be sure, but it's more likely to be known to
passing tourists than either of our institutions around here,
especially if the autoists were strangers."
</P>

<P>
"That's so," agreed Tom. The Alexian Hospital was operated under the
direction of the Brothers of that faith, and was well known in that
part of the state. Often cases of persons who had been injured by
passing automobiles had been taken there for treatment, for, as Mr.
Damon had said, it was well known, and Centerford was the nearest large
city.
</P>

<P>
"I can just about see how it happened," said Tom. "They ran Mr. Nestor
down, and stopped to pick him up after they heard his cries for help.
And the Alexian Hospital was the first one they thought of. We should
have called that up first."
</P>

<P>
But once more disappointment awaited the young inventor and his friend.
Word came back over the wire that no accident case, which bore any
resemblance to Mary's father, had been brought in.
</P>

<P>
"Well, I'm stumped!" exclaimed Tom. "What shall we do now, Mr. Damon?"
</P>

<P>
"Much as I dislike it," said the eccentric man who was too much
worried, now, to do any "blessing," which was his favorite expression,
"I think we ought to communicate with Mrs. Nestor.  She will be very
anxious."
</P>

<P>
"I guess we'll have to," said Tom. "But wait! I'll call up my house
first, and see if he has gone back there."
</P>

<P>
But Mr. Nestor had not done this, and Mrs. Baggert, who answered the
telephone, said Mary had been calling frantically for Tom, as her
mother was now on the verge of complete collapse.
</P>

<P>
"No help for it," said Tom, ruefully. "We've got to tell 'em we have no
news, and can't find him."
</P>

<P>
And, hearing this, Mrs. Nestor did collapse, and a doctor was called in.
</P>

<P>
Thereupon Tom, who with Mr. Damon had gone back to the Nestor home,
took charge of matters, sending for Mrs. Nestor's sister to come and
stay with her and take charge of the house.
</P>

<P>
"You'll need some one to stay with you," he told Mary.
</P>

<P>
"Yes, I shall," she admitted, trying bravely not to give way to her
emotion. "Oh, Tom, I wish you could stay, too. I'm sure something
dreadful must have happened to poor father. Please stay and help us
find him!"
</P>

<P>
"I will," Tom promised. "As soon as your aunt comes I'll take Mr. Damon
home, and then I'll give the rest of my time to you."
</P>

<P>
And this Tom did, sending word home that he would remain at the
Nestor's all night and part of the next day.
</P>

<P>
Tom got but little sleep that night. He communicated with the police
and saw to it that a general alarm was sent out. He called up all
hospitals within a radius of fifty miles, but could get no trace of any
injured man whose description resembled that of Mr. Nestor.
</P>

<P>
"What can have happened?" asked Mary tearfully.
</P>

<P>
"Well, the way I figure it out is this," said Tom. "Your father left my
house soon after Mr. Damon and I did in the Air Scout.  Mr. Nestor was
riding his bicycle, and he must have been run into by an automobile.
That is how his watch was damaged and that was when Mr. Damon and I
heard the cries for help."
</P>

<P>
"Oh, do you think he was badly hurt?" asked Mary.
</P>

<P>
"No, I don't," and Tom answered truthfully. "The voice sounded as
though he was in pain, certainly, but it was strong and vigorous, and
not at all as though he was dangerously hurt."
</P>

<P>
"And what do you think happened to him after he was hurt?" asked Mary.
</P>

<P>
"The autoists took him away," decided Tom. "In fact, we heard the
machine go, but of course we never connected the call for help and what
followed with your father. The autoists took him away."
</P>

<P>
"Where?"
</P>

<P>
"I should say to some hospital. Perhaps a private one of which we know
nothing, and which may be near here. I'll get a full list from the
Board of Health to-morrow. Or it may be that the autoists, seeing the
damage they had done, took your father to the home of one of
themselves, and summoned a doctor there."
</P>

<P>
"Why would they do that?"
</P>

<P>
"Well, they may have been so frightened they didn't realize what they
were doing, or they may have thought he would get better treatment in a
private house, if he were not badly injured, than if he should be taken
to a hospital. It may have been that one of the persons in the auto was
a physician, and wished to try his own skill on the man he had hurt."
</P>

<P>
"You make me feel more comfortable, Tom," said Mary. "But, even
supposing all this, why couldn't they telephone to us that my father
was all right? He always carries an identification card with him, and
if he were unconscious it could be ascertained who he was."
</P>

<P>
"That's what I can't understand," said Tom frankly. "It puzzles me. But
we'll find him&mdash;never fear!"
</P>

<P>
And so he kept on with his telephone inquiries, while a physician and
her sister ministered to Mrs. Nestor. The night was very, very long,
and no good news came in.

CHAPTER XVII
</H3>

<H3 ALIGN="center">
SILENT SAM
</H3>

<P>
Slowly the dawn broke through the mists of darkness, and made the earth
light. The sun came straggling in through cracks in the shutters in the
home of Mr. Nestor, the gradually increasing gleam paling the electric
lights, in the glare of which Tom Swift, Mary, and her aunt sat,
waiting for some word of the missing man. But none came.
</P>

<P>
"What shall we do now?" asked Mary, as she looked at Tom.
</P>

<P>
"Oh, there's lots to do," he said, trying to make his voice sound
cheerful. "We'll be busy all day. I sent word to have one of my touring
cars ready to hurry to any part of the country the moment we should get
word from your father."
</P>

<P>
"And do you think we shall get word, Tom?" the girl went on wistfully.
</P>

<P>
"Of course we shall!" he cried. "Word may come in at any time.  Now get
ready, eat a good breakfast, and then you can go with me as soon as we
hear anything definite. Come, we'll have breakfast!"
</P>

<P>
"I can't eat a thing!" protested Mary.
</P>

<P>
"Oh, yes you can," said her aunt, who was a cheerful sort of person.
"I'll see about getting something for you and Mr. Swift, and see that
your mother is all right."
</P>

<P>
She left the room to give orders to the servant about the meal, and
returned to say that Mrs. Nestor was sleeping quietly. She had been
given a sedative. Mary managed to eat a little, and she gave Tom the
address of several friends who were called up in the vain hope that,
somehow, Mr. Nestor might have gone to see them.
</P>

<P>
"Tom, what do you really think has happened?" asked Mary again, as they
sat facing one another in the library, during a respite from the
telephone.
</P>

<P>
Tom Swift repeated, to the girl his theory of what had happened with an
assumption of confidence he did not altogether feel.
</P>

<P>
His prediction of a speedy end to the suspense did not come true that
day, nor for many days. No news was heard of Mr. Nestor. After the
first day, when there was no information and when no reports came of
any one of his description having been hurt in an automobile accident
or having been taken to any hospital, the police started an energetic
search.
</P>

<P>
The authorities in all near-by cities were notified, and all thought of
keeping from the public what had happened was given over. Tom's story,
of how he and Mr. Damon had heard the cry for help on the lonely
meadow, was printed in the papers, though the young inventor did not
say that he had been out trying his new aeroplane. That was a detail
not needed in the finding of Mr. Nestor.
</P>

<P>
But Mary's father was not found. The mystery regarding his
disappearance deepened, and there was no trace of him after he had left
Tom's house that eventful evening. Persons living along the roads he
might have taken in riding his bicycle were questioned, but they had
seen nothing of him, nor were they aware of any accident. Tom's
testimony and that of Mr. Damon was all the clew there was.
</P>

<P>
"I don't believe he's dead!" stoutly declared the young inventor, when
this dire possibility had been hinted at. "I believe the persons who
were responsible for the accident are afraid to reveal his whereabouts
until he recovers from possible injuries. You'll see! Mr. Nestor will
come back safe!"
</P>

<P>
And, somehow, though her mother was skeptical, Mary believed what Tom
said.
</P>

<P>
The search was kept up, but without result, and Tom aided all he could.
But there was not much he could do. The police and other authorities
were at a total loss.
</P>

<P>
In the intervals of visiting Mary and her mother, and doing what he
could for them, Tom worked on his new motor. He knew that he was on the
right track and that all that was needed now was to make certain
refinements and adjustments in the apparatus he had already
constructed, so that it would operate more quietly.
</P>

<P>
"Absorbing the vibrations from the exhaust, caused by the exploded
gases in the cylinders, does the trick," Tom told his father.
</P>

<P>
"But there is enormous pressure to overcome, Tom. You must be sure your
muffler will stand the strain. Otherwise she is going to blow out a
gasket some day, when you least expect it. Then the sudden resumption
of pressure outside the cylinders is going to cause a change in the
equilibrium, and you may turn turtle in the air."
</P>

<P>
"I've thought of that," said Tom. "At worst it can't be any more than
looping the loop. But I'll make the muffler doubly strong."
</P>

<P>
"Better provide an auxiliary chamber to take care of part of the
exhaust in case your main apparatus breaks," advised the older
inventor, and Tom said he would. He did, too, for he valued his
father's expert advice.
</P>

<P>
Meanwhile he was busy fitting one of his latest aeroplanes with the new
motor. The motor he and Mr. Damon had used in their flight was one
patched up from an old one. But now Tom was working on a complete new
one, made after his revised model, and in which the silencer was an
integral part, instead of being built on.
</P>

<P>
While giving Mary and her mother all the assistance in his power, Tom
still found time to work on his new, pet scheme. He had matters now
where he did not fear any tampering with his plans, for he had filed
away his papers in a safe place, and was making his new machine from
memory.
</P>

<P>
"But if some one got in and had a look at the inside of your silencer
he could see how it is constructed, couldn't he?" asked Ned Newton.
</P>

<P>
"Yes," assented Tom, "But they're not going to get in very easily. Koku
sleeps in the experiment shop now, and my machine is there."
</P>

<P>
"Oh, well that explains your confidence. I feel sorry for the burglar
who makes the attempt, once Koku wakes up. Heard anything more from
those Universal people?"
</P>

<P>
"No, not directly. I understand they are working hard on some new type
of plane for army use, but I haven't bothered my head about them. I'm
too much occupied with my own affairs and trying to help Mary."
</P>

<P>
"Very strange about Mr. Nestor, isn't it?"
</P>

<P>
"Worse than strange," said Tom. "If this keeps on, and he isn't heard
from, it will be tragic pretty soon."
</P>

<P>
"He must be held a prisoner somewhere," declared Ned.
</P>

<P>
"It begins to look that way," assented Tom. "Though who would have an
object in that I can't understand. He had no enemies, as far as is
known, and his business affairs were in excellent shape. Unless, as I
said, the persons who ran him down are, through fear, keeping him
hidden until he recovers, I can't imagine what has become of him."
</P>

<P>
"Well, it certainly is a puzzle," said Ned. And Tom agreed with his
chum.
</P>

<P>
It was about a week after the disappearance of Mr. Nestor that Mr.
Damon came over to see Tom.
</P>

<P>
"Bless my shoe laces, Tom!" exclaimed the eccentric man, "but you are
as busy as ever." For he found the young inventor in the experiment
shop, surrounded by a mass of papers and all sorts of mechanical
devices.
</P>

<P>
"Yes, I'm working a little," said Tom. "But you are just in time. Come
on out, I want to introduce you to Silent Sam."
</P>

<P>
"'Silent Sam!'" exclaimed Mr. Damon. "Have you been taking a new trip
to the Land of Wonders? Have you brought back some new kind of servant?"
</P>

<P>
"Not exactly a servant," said Tom with a laugh, "though I hope Silent
Sam will serve me well."
</P>

<P>
"'Silent Sam?' What does it mean? Is that a joke?" asked the puzzled
Mr. Damon.
</P>

<P>
"I hope it doesn't turn out a joke," replied Tom. "But come on, I'll
introduce you to him, Mr. Damon."
</P>

<P>
He led the way to one of the big hangars where his various machines of
the air were housed. On the way Mr. Damon asked about news of Mr.
Nestor, but was told there was none.
</P>

<P>
Tom Swift opened the big, swinging doors and pulled aside an enveloping
canvas curtain. There stood revealed a big aeroplane, of somewhat new
pattern, the wings gleaming like silver from the varnish that had been
applied. In shape it was not unlike the machines already in use, except
that the propellers were of somewhat different design.
</P>

<P>
The engine was mounted in front, and even with his slight knowledge of
mechanics Mr. Damon could tell that it was exceedingly powerful. But it
was certain devices attached to the engine that attracted his
attention, for they were totally different from any on any other
aeroplane, though they bore some resemblance to apparatus on the plane
in which Tom and the eccentric man had made the night flight.
</P>

<P>
"Is this your new machine, Tom?" asked Mr. Damon.
</P>

<P>
"Yes."
</P>

<P>
"Well, I don't see anything of that fellow you spoke of&mdash;Silent Sam."
</P>

<P>
"This is Silent Sam," returned Tom, with a laugh. "I've named my new
noiseless aeroplane&mdash;my Air Scout&mdash;I've named that Silent Sam. Wait
until you hear it, or rather, don't hear it, and I think you'll agree
with me. Silent Sam for Uncle Sam!"
</P>

<P>
"Good!" cried Mr. Damon. "Bless my dictionary, but that's a good name!
Does it sail silently, Tom?"
</P>

<P>
"I'll let you judge presently. Silent Sam is all ready for his first
trial, and I'll be glad to have you with me. Now, I'll just&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
Tom suddenly ceased speaking and held up a hand to enjoin silence.
Then, while Mr. Damon watched, the young inventor began moving
noiselessly toward the rear of the big shed, inside which was his new
machine.
</P>

CHAPTER XVIII
</H3>

<H3 ALIGN="center">
SUSPICIONS
</H3>

<P>
"Who's there?" suddenly called Tom, and in such a sharp voice that Mr.
Damon started, ready as he was for something unusual.
</P>

<P>
There was no answer and Tom suddenly switched on all the lights in the
shed. Up to then there had been only a few glowing&mdash;just enough for him
to show the new Air Scout to his friend.
</P>

<P>
"Who's there?" asked Tom again, sharply.
</P>

<P>
"Bless my opera glasses, Tom!" cried Mr. Damon, "but are you seeing
things?"
</P>

<P>
"No; but I'm hearing them," answered Tom with a short laugh.  "Did you
think you heard some one moving around near the rudders of Silent Sam,
Mr. Damon?"
</P>

<P>
"No, I can't say that I did. Everything seems to me to be all right."
</P>

<P>
"Well, it doesn't to me," went on Tom grimly. "I think there is an
intruder in this shed, though how any one could get in when the doors
have been locked all day, is more than I can figure out. But I'm going
to have a look."
</P>

<P>
"I'll help you," offered Mr. Damon, and, in the bright glare from many
electric lights, the two began a search of the big hangar where the new
craft was kept.
</P>

<P>
But though the young inventor and his friend went around to the rear of
the aeroplane, walking in opposite directions, they saw no one, nor did
any one try to escape past them.
</P>

<P>
"And yet I was sure I heard some one in here," declared Tom, when a
search had revealed nothing. "It sounded as if some one were scuffling
softly about in rubber-soled shoes, trying to hide."
</P>

<P>
"Bless my suspenders!" cried Mr. Damon, "who do you think it could have
been, Tom?"
</P>

<P>
"Who else but some spy trying to get possession of my secrets?" was the
answer. "But I guess I was too quick for them. They couldn't learn much
from looking at the outside of my muffler, and it hasn't been
disturbed, as far as I can see."
</P>

<P>
"Who would want to gain a knowledge of it in that unlawful way?" asked
Mr. Damon.
</P>

<P>
"Perhaps some of the Universal crowd. They may have been disappointed
in perfecting a silent motor themselves, and think stealing my idea
would be the easiest way out of it."
</P>

<P>
"Do they know you are working on such a model as this Silent Sam of
yours, Tom?"
</P>

<P>
"Yes, I imagine they do. One of the firm members, as you recall,
overheard something, I think, that gave them a hint as to what my plans
were, though, thanks to the time I fooled the spy, they haven't any
real data to go by, I believe."
</P>

<P>
"Let us hope not," said Mr. Damon.
</P>

<P>
Tom and he made a thorough search of the big shed, but found no one,
nor was there any trace of an intruder. Tom notified Jackson, who, in
turn, told the guards and watchmen to be on the lookout for any
suspicious strangers, but none was seen in the vicinity of the Swift
works.
</P>

<P>
"Well, everything seems to be all right, so we'll have the test,"
remarked Tom, after a further search of the premises.  "Now, Mr.
Damon, if all goes as I hope you will see what my new machine can do.
Strain your ears for a sound, and let me know how much you hear."
</P>

<P>
His men helping him, Tom started the new motor which was tried for the
first time attached to the new craft. No flight was to be made yet, the
motor being tested as though on the block, though, in reality, the
craft was ready for instant flight if need be.
</P>

<P>
Slowly the great propellers began to revolve, and then Tom, taking his
place in the cockpit, turned on more power. The new craft&mdash;Silent
Sam&mdash;was made fast so it could not progress even though the propellers
revolved at high speed.
</P>

<P>
"I'm not sending her to the limit," said Tom to his friend, as the
young inventor throttled down the motor. "If I did I'd tear her loose
from the holding blocks."
</P>

<P>
"Her!" cried Mr. Damon. "Bless my typewriter, Tom! but I thought Silent
Sam was a gentleman aeroplane.
</P>

<P>
"So he is!" laughed the young man, frankly. "I forgot about 'Silent
Sam.' Guess I'll have to say 'him' instead of 'her,' though the latter
sounds more natural. Anyhow what do you think?"
</P>

<P>
"I think it's wonderful!" exclaimed Mr. Damon. "There the motor is,
going at almost full speed, and I can hardly hear a thing.  You can the
easier believe that when I say that I can hear you talk perfectly well.
And I guess you hear me, don't you?"
</P>

<P>
"Yes," replied Tom. "And we don't have to shout, either. This is the
best test ever! I think everything is a success."
</P>

<P>
"Are you going to take her aloft, Tom?" the eccentric man went on.
</P>

<P>
"Yes, now that I'm sure the engine is all right. Will you go for a
flight with me?"
</P>

<P>
"I certainly will! I only wish we could find him, though. I'd go with a
better heart."
</P>

<P>
"Oh! Mr. Nestor?"
</P>

<P>
"Yes, I can't imagine what has become of him. It is almost as if the
earth had opened and swallowed him. His disappearance is a great
mystery."
</P>

<P>
"It surely is," agreed Tom. "Can't seem to get any trace of him. But if
we hear another cry for help, when we have to land, you can make up
your mind I'll investigate more quickly than I did at first."
</P>

<P>
"I agree with you," said Mr. Damon.
</P>

<P>
It was nearly evening then, and until it was dark enough for his flight
Tom spent the time tuning up the engine and seeing that all was in
readiness for the latest test. He had decided not to go aloft while it
was light enough for curiosity seekers to note the flight.
</P>

<P>
Tom rather wished Mary Nestor might have a sail with him in his latest
improved silent Air Scout, but the girl was too much occupied at home
and in trying to find some trace of her father.
</P>

<P>
Tom, his father, and Mr. Damon had helped all they could, but there
were no results. A private detective had been engaged, but he had no
more of a clew than the regular police.
</P>

<P>
At last it was dark enough for the flight, and Tom and Mr. Damon took
their places in the machine. Once more the propellers were turned
around, and when the compression had been made, and the spark switched
on, around spun the big wooden blades, and the great craft moved over
the grass.
</P>

<P>
On and on and up and up sailed Tom and Mr. Damon, and as they left
behind them the shops and the Swift homestead, the two passengers were
aware of their almost silent flight. The big aeroplane, the exhaust of
which, ordinarily, would have nearly deafened them, was now as silent
as a bird.
</P>

<P>
"Silent Sam for Uncle Sam!" cried Tom in delight, as he went on faster.
"I'm sure the government ought to be glad to get this plane for air
scout work. It's a success! A great success!"
</P>

<P>
"Yes, so it is!" agreed Mr. Damon. "You do well to speak of it so, Tom."
</P>

<P>
For, modest as the young inventor was, he felt, in justice to himself,
that he must acknowledge the fact that his craft was a success. For it
rose and sailed almost as silently as a bat, and a few hundred feet
away no one, not seeing it, would have believed a big aeroplane was in
motion.
</P>

<P>
Tom and Mr. Damon flew about twenty miles at a swift pace, and all the
fault Tom had to find was that the machine was not as steady in flight
as she should have been.
</P>

<P>
"But I can remedy that with the use of some of dad's gyroscope
stabilizers," he told Mr. Damon.
</P>

<P>
They returned to the hangar safely, and the first trip of the new
Silent Sam was an assured success.
</P>

<P>
It was the following day, when Tom was busy in the machine shop
installing the gyroscopes spoken of, that Jackson came to tell him
there was a visitor to see him.
</P>

<P>
"Who is it?" asked the young inventor.
</P>

<P>
"Mr. Gale of the Universal Company," was the answer.
</P>

<P>
"I don't want to see him!" declared Tom quickly. "I have nothing to say
to him after his clumsy threats."
</P>

<P>
"He seems very much in earnest," said Jackson. "Better see him, if only
for a minute or so."
</P>

<P>
"All right, I will," assented Tom. "Show him in."
</P>

<P>
Mr. Gale, as blusteringly bluff as ever, entered the shop. Tom had
carefully put away all papers and models, as well as the finished
machines, so he had no fear that his visitor might discover some secret.
</P>

<P>
"Oh, Mr. Swift!" began the president of the Universal Company, when he
met the young inventor, "I wish to assure you that what has been done
was entirely without our knowledge. And, though this man may have acted
as our agent at one time, we repudiate any acts of his that might&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
"What are you talking about?" asked Tom in surprise. "Have I been so
impolite as to sleep during part of your talk? I don't understand what
you are driving at."
</P>

<P>
"Oh, I thought you did," said Gale, and he showed surprise. "I
understood that the man who&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
"Do you mean there was some one here in the shed last night?" cried the
young inventor suddenly, all his suspicions aroused.
</P>

<P>
"Some one here last night?" repeated Mr. Gale. "No, I don't refer to
last night. But perhaps I am making a mistake.  I&mdash;er&mdash;I&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
"Some one is making a mistake!" said Tom significantly.

CHAPTER XIX
</H3>

<H3 ALIGN="center">
ANOTHER FLIGHT
</H3>

<P>
For perhaps a quarter of a minute Tom Swift and the president of the
Universal Flying Machine Company of New York sat staring at one
another. Mr. Gale's face wore a puzzled expression, and so did Tom's.
And, after the last remark of the young inventor, the man who had
called to see him said:
</P>

<P>
"Well, perhaps we are talking at cross purposes. I don't blame you for
not feeling very friendly toward us, and if I had had my way that last
correspondence with you would never have left our office."
</P>

<P>
"It wasn't very business-like," said Tom dryly, referring to the veiled
threats when he had refused to sell his services to the rival company.
</P>

<P>
"I realize that," said Mr. Gale. "But we have some peculiar men working
for us, and sometimes there is so much to do, so many possibilities of
which to take advantage, that we may get a little off our balance. But
what I called for was not to renew our offer to you. I understand that
is definitely settled."
</P>

<P>
"As far as I am concerned, it is," said Tom, as his caller seemed to
want an answer.
</P>

<P>
"Yes. Well, then, what I called to say was that if you are thinking of
taking any legal action against us because of the action of that man
Lydane, I wish to state that he had absolutely no authority to&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
"Excuse me!" broke in Tom, "but by Lydane do you mean the man who also
posed as Bower, the spy?"
</P>

<P>
"No, I do not. Though I regret to say that Bower once worked for us.
He, too, had no authority to come here and get a position. He was still
in our service when he did that."
</P>

<P>
"So I have suspected," said Tom. "I realize now that he was a spy, who
came here to try to find out for you some of my secrets."
</P>

<P>
"Not with my permission!" exclaimed Mr. Gale. "I was against that from
the first and I came to tell you so. But Bower really did you no harm."
</P>

<P>
"No, he didn't get the chance!" chuckled Tom. "Nor did that other
spy&mdash;the one with the gold tooth. I wonder how he liked our mud hole?"
</P>

<P>
"He was Lydane," said Mr. Gale. "It is about him I came."
</P>

<P>
"You might have saved yourself the trouble," returned Tom. "I don't
wish to discuss him."
</P>

<P>
"But I wish to make sure," said Mr. Gale, "that what he has done will
not come back on us. We repudiate him entirely. His methods we can not
countenance. He is too daring&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
"Oh, don't worry!" interrupted Tom. "He hasn't done anything to me&mdash;he
didn't get the chance, as I guess he's told you. You needn't apologize
on his account. He did me no harm, and&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
"But I understood from him that&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
"Now I don't want to seem impolite!" broke in Tom, "nor do I want to
take pattern after some of your company's acts, if not your own. But I
am very busy. I have an important test to make for the government, and
my time is fully occupied. I am afraid I shall have to bid you
good-morning and&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
"But won't you give me a chance to&mdash;" began the president.
</P>

<P>
"Now, the less we discuss this matter the better!" interrupted Tom.
"Lydane, as you call the man with the gold tooth didn't really do
anything to me nor any great harm to any of my possessions, as far as I
can learn. His career is a closed book&mdash;a book with muddy covers!" and
the young inventor laughed.
</P>

<P>
"Oh, well, if you look at it that way, there is nothing further for me
to say," said Mr. Gale stiffly. "I understood&mdash; But hasn't my partner,
Mr. Ware, seen you?" he asked Tom quickly.
</P>

<P>
"No. And I don't care to see him."
</P>

<P>
"Oh, then that accounts for it," was the quick answer. "Well, if you
regard the matter as closed I suppose we should also. We are not to
blame for what Lydane does when he is no longer in our employ, and we
repudiate anything he may do, or may have done."
</P>

<P>
This struck Tom, afterward, as being rather a queer remark, but he did
not think so at the time.
</P>

<P>
The truth was that the young inventor wished very much to try out a new
device on his noiseless aeroplane and wanted to get rid of Mr. Gale
before doing so. So he did not pay as much attention to the remarks of
the president as, otherwise, he might have done.
</P>

<P>
It was not until after Mr. Gale had taken his leave and Tom had
finished the particular work on which he was engaged when the president
of the rival company came in, that the young man did some hard
thinking. And this thinking was done after he had received a telephone
call from Mary Nestor, asking, if by any chance, he had heard anything
like a clew as to the whereabouts of her father.
</P>

<P>
Tom had been obliged to tell her that he had not. Everything possible
was being done to find the missing man but he had disappeared as
completely as though he had ridden on his bicycle into the crater of
some extinct volcano on the meadow, and had fallen to the bottom.
</P>

<P>
An effort was made to trace him through an automobile association which
had a large membership. That is, the members were asked to make
inquiries to ascertain, if possible, whether any one had heard of an
unreported accident&mdash;one in which Mr. Nestor might have been carried
away by persons who accidently ran him down.
</P>

<P>
But this came to naught, and the police and other authorities were at a
loss how farther to proceed. It was a theory in some quarters that Mr.
Nestor was perfectly safe, but that he was out of his mind, and was
either wandering around, not knowing who he was, or was, in this
condition, detained somewhere, the persons having him in charge not
realizing that he was the missing man so widely sought.
</P>

<P>
This belief was a relief to Mrs. Nestor and Mary in many ways for it
prevented them from giving way to the fear that Mr. Nestor was dead.
That he was alive was Tom Swift's firm opinion, and he was doing all he
could to prove it.
</P>

<P>
It was not until the day after the visit of Mr. Gale that Tom, having
concluded some intricate calculations about the strength of cylinder
valves, uttered an exclamation.
</P>

<P>
"I wonder if he could have meant that?" cried the young inventor. "I
wonder if he could have meant that? I must find out at once! Queer I
didn't think of that before!"
</P>

<P>
He put in a long distance call to New York, asking to speak to Mr.
Gale. But when, eventually, he was connected with the office of the
Universal Flying Machine Company he was told that Mr. Gale and Mr. Ware
had sailed for France that day, going over as government
representatives to investigate aeroplane motors.  Gale's visit to Tom
had been just previous to taking the boat, it was said.
</P>

<P>
"This is tough luck!" mused Tom, his suspicions doubly aroused now. "I
can't let this rest here! I've got to get after it! As soon as I make
this final test, and invite Uncle Sam's experts out to see how my
noiseless motor works, I'll get after Gale and Ware if I have to follow
them to the battlefields of France! I wonder if it was that he was
hinting at all the while! I begin to believe it was!"
</P>

<P>
Tom Swift had decided on another flight for his new craft before he
would let the government experts see it.
</P>

<P>
"Silent Sam must do his very best work for Uncle Sam before I turn him
over," said the young inventor.
</P>

<P>
"And after this flight I'll offer the machine to the government, and
then devote all my time to finding Mr. Nestor," said Tom. "I'd do it
now, but private matters, however deeply they affect us, must be put
aside to help win the war. But this will end my inventive work until
after Mr. Nestor is found&mdash;if he's alive."
</P>

<P>
Preparations for the test flight went on apace, and one afternoon Tom
and Jackson took their places in the big, new aeroplane. He no longer
feared daylight crowds in case of an accident. They made a good start,
and the motor was so quiet that as Tom passed over his own plant the
men working in the yard, who did not know of the flight, did not look
up to see what was going on. They could not hear the engine.
</P>

<P>
"I think we've got everything just as we want it, Jackson," said Tom,
much pleased.
</P>

<P>
"I believe you," answered the mechanician. "It couldn't be better. Now
if&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
And at that moment there came a loud explosion, and Silent Sam began
drifting rapidly toward the earth, as falls a bird with a broken wing.
</P>

QUEER MARKS
</H3>

<P>
"What happened?" cried Jackson to Tom, as he leaned forward in his seat
which was in the rear of the young inventor's.
</P>

<P>
"Don't know, exactly," was the answer, as Tom quickly shifted the
rudders to correct the slanting fall of his craft. "Sounded as though
there was a tremendous back-fire, or else the muffler blew up. The
engine is dead."
</P>

<P>
"Can you take her down safely?"
</P>

<P>
"Oh, yes, I guess so. She's a bit out of control, but the stabilizer
will keep her on a level keel. Good thing we installed it."
</P>

<P>
"You're right!" said Jackson.
</P>

<P>
Now they were falling earthward with great rapidity, but, thanks to the
gyroscope stabilizer, the "side-slipping," than which there is no
motion more dreaded by an aviator, had nearly ceased. The craft was
volplaning down as it ought, and Tom had it under as perfect control as
was possible under the circumstances.
</P>

<P>
"We'll get down all right if something else doesn't happen," he said to
Jackson, with grim humor.
</P>

<P>
"Well, let's hope that it won't," said the mechanic. "We're a good
distance up yet."
</P>

<P>
They were, as a matter of fact, for the explosion, or whatever had
happened to the craft, had occurred at a height of over two miles, and
they at once began falling. As yet Tom Swift was unaware of the exact
nature of the accident or its cause. All he knew was that there had
been a big noise and that the engine had stopped working. He could not
see the silencer from where he sat, as it was constructed on the
underside of the motor, but he had an idea that the same sort of mishap
had occurred as on the occasion when the test machine had sailed
through the roof of his workshop.
</P>

<P>
"But, luckily, this wasn't as bad," mused Tom. "Anyhow the motor is out
of business."
</P>

<P>
And this was very evident. The young inventor had tried to start the
apparatus after its stoppage by the explosion, but it had not responded
to his efforts, and then he had desisted, fearing to cause some further
damage, or, perhaps, endanger his own life and that of Jackson.
</P>

<P>
Down, down swept Silent Sam&mdash;doubly silent now, and Tom began looking
about for a good place to make a landing. This was nothing new for
either him or his mechanician, and they accepted the outcome as a
matter of course.
</P>

<P>
"Not a very lively place down there," remarked Jackson, as he looked
over the side of the cockpit.
</P>

<P>
"If we have to depend for help on any one down there, I guess we'll be
a long time waiting," agreed Tom. They were about to land in a very
lonely spot. It was one he had never before visited, though he knew it
could not be much more than twenty miles from his own home, as they had
not flown much farther than that distance.
</P>

<P>
But, somehow or other, Tom had not visited this particular section, and
knew nothing of it. He saw below him, as Jackson had seen, a lonely
stretch of country&mdash;a big field, once a wood-lot, evidently, as
scattered about were some stumps and some second growth trees. There
were also a number of evergreens&mdash;Christmas trees Jackson called them.
And this was the only open place for miles, the surrounding country
being a densely wooded one. There did not appear to be a house or other
building in sight where they might seek help.
</P>

<P>
"But maybe we can make the repairs ourselves and keep on," the lad
thought.
</P>

<P>
With practiced eye he picked out a smooth, grassy, level spot, in the
midst of scattered evergreen trees, and there Tom Swift skillfully
brought his Air Scout to rest. With a gentle thud the rubber-tired
wheels struck the Earth, rolled along a little distance, and then
called to a stop.
</P>

<P>
Hardly had the aeroplane ceased moving when Tom and his companion
jumped out and began eagerly to examine the machinery to see the extent
of damage.
</P>

<P>
"I thought so!" Tom exclaimed. "The silencer cracked under the strain.
Those exhaust gases have more pressure that I believed possible. I
increased the margin of safety on this muffler, too.  But she's
cracked, and I can't use the machine until I put on a new one. Good
thing I didn't ask for a government inspection until after this trial
flight."
</P>

<P>
"That's so," agreed Jackson. "But can't you patch it up, or go on
without a muffler, so we can get back home?"
</P>

<P>
"I'm afraid not," Tom answered. "You see I removed all the old exhaust
pipe fittings when I put on my new silencer. Now if I took off my
attachment there wouldn't be anything to carry off the discharged
gases, and they'd form a regular cloud about us.  We couldn't stand it
without gas masks, such as they use in the trenches, and we haven't any
of those with us."
</P>

<P>
"That's right," agreed Jackson. "Well, what do you want to do?  Have me
stay here and guard the machine while you go for help? Or shall I go?"
</P>

<P>
"I don't know why we both can't go," said Tom. "There is no use trying
to patch up this machine here. I'll have to send a truck after it, and
dismantle it before I can get it home.
</P>

<P>
"As for either of us staying here on guard, I don't quite see the need
of that. This looks like the jumping-off place to me. I don't believe
there's a native within miles. I didn't see any houses as we came down,
and I think Silent Sam will be perfectly safe here. No one can run off
with him, anyhow. He'd be as hard to start as an automobile with all
four wheels gone. Let's leave it here and both walk back."
</P>

<P>
"All right," agreed Jackson. "That suits me. Might as well leave our
togs here, too. It will be easier walking without them," and he began
taking off the fur-lined suit, his cap, and his goggles, such as he and
Tom wore against the piercing cold of the upper regions.
</P>

<P>
"We can stuff them in the cockpit and leave them," went on the
mechanician, as he divested himself of his garments. As he stowed them
away in his seat he gave one more look at the broken muffler. As Tom
Swift said, his new silencer had literally blown up, a large piece
having been torn from the gas chamber.
</P>

<P>
Something that Jackson saw caused him to utter an exclamation that
brought Tom Swift to his side.
</P>

<P>
"What is it?" asked the young inventor.
</P>

<P>
"Look!" was the answer. "See! Just at the edge of that break!  It's
been filed to make the metal thinner there than anywhere else. You
didn't do that, did you?"
</P>

<P>
"I should say not!" cried Tom. "Why, to file there would mean to weaken
the whole structure."
</P>

<P>
"And that's exactly what's happened!" declared Jackson, as he gave
another look. "Some one has filed this nearly through&mdash;leaving only a
thin metal skin, and when the gas pressure became too much it blew out.
That's what happened!"
</P>

<P>
Tom Swift made a quick but thorough examination.
</P>

<P>
"You're right, Jackson!" he exclaimed. "That was filed deliberately to
cause the accident. And it must have been done lately, for I carefully
inspected the silencer when I put it on, and it was in perfect order.
There's been spy work here. Some one got into the hangar and filed that
casing. Then the accumulated pressure of the gases did the rest."
</P>

<P>
"As sure as you're alive!" agreed Jackson. "Maybe that's what Gale did
when he called."
</P>

<P>
"No," returned Tom, shaking his head, "he didn't get a chance to do
anything like that. I watched him all the while. But perhaps this is
what he referred to when he said he and his company would repudiate any
act of that spy with the gold tooth&mdash;Lydane, so Gale said his name was.
Maybe that's what Lydane did."
</P>

<P>
"He was capable of it," agreed the mechanic, "but he couldn't have done
it that time you tripped him into the mud puddle. This silencer wasn't
built then."
</P>

<P>
"No, you're right," assented Tom. "Then he must have been around since,
doing some of his tricky work!"
</P>

<P>
"I don't see how that could have been," said Jackson slowly.  "We've
kept a very careful watch, and your shop has been specially guarded."
</P>

<P>
"I know it has," said Tom. "There couldn't much get past Koku; but some
one seems to have done it, or else how could that filing have been
done?"
</P>

<P>
Jackson shook his head. The problem was too much for him. He looked
carefully at the exploded and broken silencer, and Tom, too, gave it a
critical eye. There was no doubt but that it had been filed in several
places to weaken the structure of the metal.
</P>

<P>
"When did you last see that it was in perfect condition?" asked Jackson.
</P>

<P>
Tom named a certain date.
</P>

<P>
"That was just before Gale called," observed the mechanician.  "He
might have known of it."
</P>

<P>
"I wish I'd known of it at the time," said Tom savagely. "He wouldn't
have gotten away as easily as he did. Well, there's no use standing
here talking about it. Let's get back to civilization and we'll send
back one of the trucks. Luckily I have another silencer I can put on
for the government test. This one will never be of any more use, though
I may be able to save some of the valves and baffle plates."
</P>

<P>
Slowly they turned from the disabled aeroplane and started to look for
a path that would lead them out of the lonely place. Tom as the first
to strike what seemed to be a cow path, or perhaps what had been a road
into the wood lot in the early days.
</P>

<P>
As he tramped along it, followed by Jackson, the young inventor
suddenly stopped, as he came to a sandy place, and, stooping over,
looked intently at some queer marks in the soil.
</P>

<P>
"What is it?" asked the mechanician.
</P>

<P>
"Looks like the marks of an automobile," said Tom slowly. "And I was
just trying to remember where I'd seen marks like these before."
</P>

CHAPTER XXI
</H3>

<H3 ALIGN="center">
THE DESERTED CABIN
</H3>

<P>
For several seconds the young inventor remained bending over the queer
marks in that little sandy path of the lonely field in the midst of the
silent woods. Jackson watched him curiously, and then Tom straightened
up, exclaiming as he did so:
</P>

<P>
"I have it! Now I know where it was! I saw marks like these the night
Mr. Nestor disappeared. Mr. Damon and I noticed the marks in the dust
on the road the time we made the forced landing the first night we
tried out the silent motor. That's it! They are the same marks! I'm
sure of it!"
</P>

<P>
"I wouldn't go so far as to say that," said Jackson slowly. He was more
deliberate than Tom Swift, a fact for which the young inventor was
often glad, as it saved him from impulsive mistakes.
</P>

<P>
"This may not be the same auto," went on the mechanician. "I'll admit I
never saw square tire marks like those before. Most of the usual ones
are circular, diamond-shape or oblong. Some tire manufacturer must have
tried a new stunt. But as for saying these marks were made by the same
machine you saw evidences of the night Mr. Nestor disappeared, why,
that's going a little too far, Tom."
</P>

<P>
"Yes, I suppose it is," admitted the young inventor. "But it's a clew
worth following. Maybe Mr. Nestor has been brought to some lonely place
like this, and is being held."
</P>

<P>
"Why would any one want to do that?" asked Jackson. "He had no enemies."
</P>

<P>
"Well, perhaps those who ran him down and injured him are afraid to let
him go for fear he will prosecute them and ask for heavy damages,"
suggested Tom. "They may be holding him a captive until he gets well,
and aim on treating him so nicely that he won't bring suit."
</P>

<P>
"That's a pretty far-fetched theory," said the mechanician as he
carefully looked at the tracks. "But of course it may be true.  Anyhow,
these tire marks are rather recent, I should say, and they are made by
a new tire. Do you think we can follow them?"
</P>

<P>
"I'm going to try!" declared Tom. "The only trouble is we can't tell
whether it was going or coming&mdash;that is we don't know which way to go."
</P>

<P>
"That's so," agreed his companion. "And so the only thing to do is to
travel a bit both ways. The path, or road, or whatever you call it, is
plainly enough marked here, though you can't always pick out the tire
marks. They show only on bare ground. The grass doesn't leave any
tracks that we can see, though doubtless they are there.
</P>

<P>
"But as for thinking this car is the same one the marks of which you
saw on the lonely moor, the night you heard the call for help&mdash;that's
going too far, Tom Swift."
</P>

<P>
"Yes, I realize that. Of course there must be more than one car with
tires which have square protuberances. But it's worth taking a chance
on&mdash;following this clew."
</P>

<P>
"Oh, sure!" agreed Jackson.
</P>

<P>
"The only question is, then, which way to go," returned Tom.
</P>

<P>
They settled that, arbitrarily enough, by going on in the direction
they had started after leaving the stranded airship.  They followed a
half-defined path, and were rewarded by getting occasional glimpses on
bare ground of the odd tire marks.
</P>

<P>
Through a devious winding way, now hidden amid a lane of trees, and
again cutting across an open space, the path led. They saw the marks
often enough to make sure they were on the right trail, and in one
place they saw several different patches of the odd marks.
</P>

<P>
They went on perhaps half a mile more, when they came to a lonely road
and saw where the car had turned from that into the wood-lot, as Tom
called the place where his craft had settled down.
</P>

<P>
"Look!" cried the young inventor to Jackson. "They've been here more
than once, and have gone along the road in both directions.  They seem
to have used this turning into the lot as a sort of stopping place."
</P>

<P>
This was plain enough from an examination of the marks in the sandy
soil of the road, which was one not often used. The automobile with the
queer, square marks on the tires had turned into the lot, coming and
going in both directions.
</P>

<P>
"This settles it!" cried Tom, when he finished making an examination.
"There's something farther back in this lot that we've got to see. This
auto has been coming and going, and we should have followed the tracks
the other way from the point where we first saw them, instead of coming
this way."
</P>

<P>
"Except that we've learned the place of departure," suggested Jackson.
"Evidently the wood-lot is a blind alley. The car goes in, but it can
come out only just at this point, or, at least, it does."
</P>

<P>
"That's right!" agreed Tom. "Now the thing to do is to follow our track
back to where we started. There must be some place where the car went
to&mdash;some headquarters, or meeting place with some one, farther back in
the lot. If we can only follow the trail back as well as we did coming,
we may find out something."
</P>

<P>
"Well, let's try, anyhow," suggested Jackson.
</P>

<P>
They had no difficulty in making their way back to the spot where they
had first seen the queer marks. But from then on their task was not so
easy. For sandy or bare patches of earth were not frequent, and they
had to depend on these to give them direction, for the road was
overgrown and not well defined.
</P>

<P>
Often they would search about for some time after leaving one patch of
the marks before they found another that would justify them in keeping
on.
</P>

<P>
"They have headquarters, or a rendezvous, somewhere back in this lot!"
declared Tom, as they hurried on. "I think we're on the track of a
mystery."
</P>

<P>
"Unless it turns out that some farmer has treated himself to an auto
with new tires of square tread, and is hauling wood," said Jackson. "It
may turn out that way."
</P>

<P>
"Yes, it may," agreed Tom. "But, taking everything into consideration,
I think we're on the verge of finding out something. Even if we do
discover that the owner of this auto is only hauling wood, he may be
able to help us to a clew as to the whereabouts of Mr. Nestor."
</P>

<P>
"How?"
</P>

<P>
"Well, maybe he was in his machine on the moor the night the call for
help came. He may even have aided to carry Mr. Nestor away. And if he
doesn't know a thing about it&mdash;which, of course, is possible&mdash;the man
who bought these queer tires can tell us who makes them, or who deals
in them, and we can find out what autoists around here have their cars
equipped with this odd tread."
</P>

<P>
"Yes," agreed Jackson, "that can be done."
</P>

<P>
And so they kept on, scouting here and there to either side of the
half-defined path, until they were far back from the spot where they
had left the Air Scout.
</P>

<P>
"We don't appear to be getting any warmer, as the children say,"
remarked Jackson, as he straightened up and looked about, for his back
ached from so much stooping over to look for the odd marks.
</P>

<P>
"We haven't seen anything yet, I'll admit," said Tom. "But it won't be
dark for another hour or so, and I vote that we keep on."
</P>

<P>
"Oh, I wasn't thinking of giving up!" exclaimed Jackson. "If there's
anything here&mdash;at the end of the route, as you might say&mdash;we'll find
it. Only I hope it doesn't turn out to be just a wood pile, from which
some farmer has been hauling logs."
</P>

<P>
"That would be a disappointment," assented Tom.
</P>

<P>
The day was waning, and they realized that they ought not to spend too
much time on what might turn out to be a wild goose chase. They were in
a lonely neighborhood, and while they were not at all apprehensive of
danger, they felt it would be best to get to shelter before dark.
</P>

<P>
"We'll want to send word to Mr. Swift that we're all right."
</P>

<P>
"Yes," said Tom, "I'd like to get to a place where I can telephone to
him or Mrs. Baggert. Well, if we don't find something pretty soon we'll
have to turn back. I must complete work on the new motor, for if I'm to
offer it to Uncle Sam for air scout purposes, the sooner I can do so
the better. Things are getting pretty hot over in Europe, and if ever
the United States needed aircraft on the western front they need them
now. I want to help all I can, and I also want to help Mary&mdash;you
understand&mdash;Miss Nestor."
</P>

<P>
"I understand," said Jackson simply. "I only hope you can help her. But
I'm afraid&mdash;this may turn out to be nothing&mdash;following these marks, you
know."
</P>

<P>
"And yet," said Tom slowly, "it would be strange if it was only a
coincidence&mdash;the two tire marks being the same&mdash;the night Mr. Nestor
disappeared and now."
</P>

<P>
And so they kept on, hoping.
</P>

<P>
The half-defined path through the wood-lot led them in a series of
turns and twists, and it extended through a dense patch of woods,
growing thickly, where it was so dark that it seemed as if night had
fallen.
</P>

<P>
"We can't spend much more time here," said Tom. "If we don't find
something in the next half mile we'll go back and take up the search
to-morrow. I'm going to find out what's at the end of this road&mdash;even
if it's only a wood pile."
</P>

<P>
For ten minutes more the two went on, making sure, by occasional
glimpses at the marks, that they were on the right track. Then,
suddenly, they saw something which made them feel sure they had reached
their goal.
</P>

<P>
In a clearing among the trees was a little cabin&mdash;a shack of logs&mdash;and
from the appearance it was deserted. There was not a sign of life
around.
</P>

<H3 ALIGN="center">
CLEWS AT LAST
</H3>

<P>
For a moment, at sight of the deserted cabin, staring at Tom and his
friend, as it were, from its hiding place amid the trees, the young
inventor and his companion did not move. They just stood looking at the
place.
</P>

<P>
"Well," said Tom, at length, "we found it, didn't we?"
</P>

<P>
"We found something anyhow," agreed Jackson. "Whether it amounts to
anything or not, we've got to see."
</P>

<P>
"Come on!" cried Tom, impulsively. "I'm going to see what's there."
</P>

<P>
"There doesn't appear to be much of anything," said Jackson, as he
looked toward the lonely cabin with critical eyes. "I should say that
place hadn't been used, even as a chicken coop, in a long while."
</P>

<P>
"We can soon tell!" exclaimed Tom, striding forward.
</P>

<P>
"Wait just a minute!" cried his companion, catching him by the coat.
"Don't be in such a hurry."
</P>

<P>
"Why not?" asked Tom. "There isn't any danger, is there?"
</P>

<P>
"I don't know about that. There's no telling who may be hidden in that
cabin, in spite of its deserted appearance. And though there aren't any
'No Trespass' signs up, it may be that we wouldn't be welcome. If there
are some tramps there, which is possible, they might take a notion to
shoot at us first and ask questions as to our peaceable intentions
afterward&mdash;when it would be too late."
</P>

<P>
"Nonsense!" exclaimed Tom. "There aren't any tramps there and, if there
were, they wouldn't dare shoot. I'm going to see what the mystery
is&mdash;if there is one."
</P>

<P>
But there was no sign of life, and, taking this as an indication that
their advance would not be disputed, Jackson followed Tom. The latter
advanced until he could take in all the details of the shack. It was
made of logs, and once had been chinked with mud or clay. Some of this
had fallen out, leaving spaces between the tree trunks.
</P>

<P>
"It wasn't a bad little shack at one time," decided Tom. "Maybe it was
a place where some one camped out during the summer. But it hasn't been
used of late. I never knew there was such a place around here, and I
thought I knew this locality pretty well."
</P>

<P>
"I never heard of it, either," said Jackson. "Let's give a shout and
see if there's any one around. They may be asleep.  Hello, there!" he
called in sufficiently vigorous tones to have awakened an ordinary
sleeper.
</P>

<P>
Put there was no answer, and as the shadows of the night began to fall,
the place took on a most lonely aspect.
</P>

<P>
"Let's go up and knock&mdash;or go in if the door's open," suggested Tom.
"We can't lose any more time, if we're to get out of here before night."
</P>

<P>
"Go ahead," said Jackson, and together they went to the cabin door.
</P>

<P>
"Locked!" exclaimed Tom, as he saw a padlock attached to a chain. It
appeared to be fastened through two staples, driven one into the door
and the other into the jamb, at right angles to one another and
overlapping.
</P>

<P>
"Knock!" suggested Jackson. But when Tom had done so, and there was no
answer, the machinist took hold of the lock. To his own surprise and
that of Tom, one of the staples pulled out and the door swung open. The
place had evidently been forced before, and the lock had not been
opened by a key. The staple had been pulled out and replaced loosely in
the holes.
</P>

<P>
For a moment nothing could be made out in the dark interior of the
shack. But as their eyes became used to the gloom, Tom and his
companion were able to see that the shack consisted of two rooms.
</P>

<P>
In the first one there was a rusty stove, a table, and some chairs, and
it was evident, from pans and skillets hanging on the wall, as well as
from a small cupboard built on one side, that this was the kitchen and
living room combined.
</P>

<P>
"Anybody here?" cried Tom, as he stepped inside.
</P>

<P>
Only a dull echo answered.
</P>

<P>
The two could now see where a door gave entrance to an inner room, and
this, a quick glance showed, was the sleeping apartment, two bunks
being built on the side walls.
</P>

<P>
"Well, somebody had it pretty comfortable here," decided Tom, as he
looked around. "They've been cooking and sleeping here, and not so very
long ago, either. It wouldn't be such a bad place if it was cleaned
out."
</P>

<P>
"That's right," agreed Jackson. "Wouldn't mind camping here myself, if
there was any fishing near."
</P>

<P>
"The river can't be far away," suggested Tom. "And now let's see what
we can find, and see if we can get a line on who has been here. But
first we'll let in a little light."
</P>

<P>
He opened a window in the sleeping room, and pushed back the heavy
plank shutter that had been closed. When the light entered it was seen
that both bunks bore evidence of having been lately slept in. The
blankets were tossed back, as if the occupants had risen, and in the
outer room, on the stove, were signs that indicated a meal had been
served not many days gone by.
</P>

<P>
"Now," observed Tom musingly, as he wandered about the place, "if we
could only find out who owns this, and who has been here lately&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
Jackson stooped over, and, thrusting aside an end of the blankets that
trailed on the floor from one of the bunks, picked up something.
</P>

<P>
"What is it?" asked Tom.
</P>

<P>
"Looks like a leather pocketbook," was the answer. "That's what it is,"
the mechanic went on, as he held the object to the light.  "It's a
wallet."
</P>

<P>
"Let me see it!" exclaimed Tom quickly. He took the wallet from the
hands of Jackson. Then the young inventor uttered a cry. "A clew at
last!" he exclaimed. "A clew at last! Mr. Nestor has been in this
cabin!"
</P>

<P>
"How do you know?" asked Jackson quickly.
</P>

<P>
"This is his wallet," said Tom excitedly. "I've often seen him have it.
In fact he had it with him on Earthquake Island, the time I sent the
wireless message for help. I saw it several times then. He kept in it
what few papers he had saved from the wreck.  And I've seen it often
enough since. That's Mr. Nestor's wallet all right. Besides, if you
want any other evidence&mdash;look!" He opened the leather flaps and showed
Jackson on one, stamped in gold letters, the name of Mary's father.
</P>

<P>
"Well, what do you make of it, Tom?" asked the mechanician, as he
finished his examination of the wallet. "What does it mean?  The
pocket-book is empty and that&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
"Might mean almost anything," completed Tom. "But it's a clew all
right! He's been here, and I'm pretty certain he was brought here in
the auto with the odd tires&mdash;the one Mr. Damon and I saw traces of the
night we heard the cries for help."
</P>

<P>
"But that doesn't help us now," said Jackson. "The point is to find out
how lately Mr. Nestor was here, and what has happened to him since.
There isn't anything in the wallet, is there?"
</P>

<P>
"Nothing," answered Tom, making a careful examination so as to be sure.
"It's as empty as a last year's bird nest. He's been robbed&mdash;that's
what has happened to Mr. Nestor. He was waylaid that night, instead of
being run down as I thought&mdash;waylaid and robbed and then his body was
brought here."
</P>

<P>
"There you go again, Tom! Jumping to conclusions!" said Jackson, with a
friendly smile, and with the familiarity of an old and valued helper.
"Maybe he's in perfectly good health. Just because you found his empty
wallet doesn't argue that your friend is in serious trouble. He may
have dropped this on the road and some one picked it up. I'll admit
they may have taken whatever was in it, but that doesn't prove
anything. The thing for us to do is to find out who knows about this
shack; who owns it, on whose land it is, and whether any one has been
seen here lately."
</P>

<P>
"They've been here lately whether they've been seen or not," said Tom
positively. "There are the auto tracks. It rained two days ago, and the
tracks were made since. Mr. Nestor must have been here within two days."
</P>

<P>
"He may or may not," said Jackson. "Say, rather, that some one was here
and left his wallet after him. Now see if we can find other clews!"
</P>

<P>
They looked about in the fast fading light, but at first could discover
nothing more than evidences that three or four persons had been living
in the shack and at some recent date&mdash;probably within a day or two.
</P>

<P>
They had had their meals there and had slept there. But this seemed to
be all that could be established, other than that Mr. Nestor's wallet
was there, stripped of its contents.
</P>

<P>
Tom was looking through the closet, from which a frightened chipmunk
sprang as he opened the door. There were the remains of some food,
which accounted for the presence of the little striped animal. And, as
Tom poked about, his hand came in contact with something wrapped in
paper on an upper shelf. It was something that clinked metallicly.
</P>

<P>
"What's that?" asked Jackson. "Knives, or some other weapons?"
</P>

<P>
"Neither," answered Tom. "It's a couple of files, and they've been used
lately. I can see something in the grooves yet and&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
Suddenly Tom ceased speaking and drew from his pocket a small but
powerful magnifying glass. Through this he looked at one of the files,
taking it out in front of the shack where the light was better.
</P>

<P>
"I thought so!" he cried. "Look here, Jackson!"
</P>

<P>
"What is it?"
</P>

<P>
"Another clew!" answered Tom.
</P>

<BR><BR><BR>

<A NAME="chap23"></A>
<H3 ALIGN="center">
CHAPTER XXIII
</H3>

<H3 ALIGN="center">
THE GOVERNMENT TEST
</H3>

<P>
For a moment Jackson thought Tom had discovered a clew to, or evidences
of, some crime. He had an unpleasant suspicion, for an instant, that
there was blood on the files, and that it might prove to be the blood
of Mr. Nestor.
</P>

<P>
But the satisfaction that showed on Tom's face did not seem to indicate
such dire possibilities as these.
</P>

<P>
"What is it?" asked Jackson, unable to guess at what Tom was looking
through the powerful glass. "What do you see?"
</P>

<P>
"Metal filings on the grooves of these files," said the young inventor.
"And, unless I'm greatly mistaken, the particles of filings are from
the case of my aircraft silencer!"
</P>

<P>
"What!" cried the machinist. "Do you mean those are the files used in
weakening the outer case of your new machine, so that it burst a little
while ago?"
</P>

<P>
"That's what I think," answered Tom. "I know it sounds pretty
far-fetched," he went on. "But take a look for yourself. If those
particles on, the files aren't exactly of the same color and texture as
the material of which the silencer case is made, I'll never build
another machine."
</P>

<P>
Jackson peered through the powerful glass moving out a little farther
from the shack, so as to get the best light possible on the subject of
his examination. It was fast getting dark, but there was enough glow in
the western sky for his purpose.
</P>

<P>
"Am I right?" asked Tom.
</P>

<P>
"You're right!" declared his helper. "This is exactly the same metal as
that of which your silencer case is made. It's a peculiar mixture of
aluminum and vanadium steel. I never knew it used in any shop but
yours, and these filings are certainly of that metal. It would seem,
Tom, that these were the files used to cut a crease in the case of your
silencer to weaken it so it would burst."
</P>

<P>
"My idea exactly!" cried Tom. "The spy, who got into my shop in some
undiscovered manner, did his work and then fled here to hide. He left
his files behind. Mr. Nestor must have been here, either before or
after. No, I'll not say that, either. Finding his wallet here doesn't
prove that he was here. It might have been brought here by one of the
spies and dropped. But I'm sure we're on the track of the men who
damaged my airship, as well as those who know something of the mystery
of Mr. Nestor."
</P>

<P>
"I agree with you," said Jackson. "Of course there's a possibility that
the same peculiar metal you used in your silencer case may have been
used in some other machine shop, and these files may have come from
there, and have been employed in perfectly regular work. But the
chances are&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
"There's only one way to make sure," said Tom. "Let's take the files
with us and see if they fit in the grooves where the break came. We'll
take these back to where we left the Air Scout," and he clinked the
files he held.
</P>

<P>
"We can just about make it before it gets black dark," returned
Jackson. "But that won't give us any more time to look around here,"
and he indicated the hut.
</P>

<P>
"I fancy we've seen all there is to see here," said Tom. "Mr. Nestor
isn't here, and whether he was or not is a question.  Anyhow, some one
was here who had something to do with him after his disappearance, I'm
positive of that. And I'm sure some one was here who damaged my
airship. Now we'll run down both those clews, find out who owns this
place, who has been using it, and all we can along that line. So, if
you're ready, let's travel."
</P>

<P>
The two set out to make their way back to where they had left the
stranded airship. It was fast becoming dark, but they could hurry along
with more speed now, as they did not have to stop to look for the marks
of the peculiar automobile tires. They had noticed the path along which
they had traveled, and in half the time they had spent coming they were
back where the Air Scout rested undisturbed in the meadow amid the
trees.
</P>

<P>
Making sure that, as far as they could tell, no one had visited the
craft since they had left it, Tom and Jackson compared the file marks
on what was left of the broken silencer case with the files they had
found in the hut. They used a small, but powerful electric lamp to aid
them in this examination, as it was too dark to see otherwise, and what
they saw caused the young inventor to exclaim:
</P>

<P>
"That settles it! These were the files used!"
</P>

<P>
"That's right!" agreed his assistant. "You've called the turn, Tom. The
next thing to do is to find who connects with the files."
</P>

<P>
"Yes. To do that and find Mr. Nestor," said Tom. "We have plenty of
work ahead of us. But let's get nearer civilization and send some word
to the folks at home. They'll be getting worried."
</P>

<P>
"It doesn't seem as if there was a way out of here without using an
airship," remarked Jackson.
</P>

<P>
But he and Tom finally reached the seldom-used road which ran along the
field that contained the lonely shack, and, following this, they
reached a farmhouse about a mile farther on. Greatly to their relief,
there was a telephone in the place. True it was only a party line, set
up by some neighboring farmers for their own private use, but one of
the subscribers, to whose home the private line ran, had a long
distance instrument, and after a talk with him, this man promised Tom
to call up Mr. Swift and acquaint him with the fact that his son and
Jackson were all right, and would be home later.
</P>

<P>
"And now," said Tom, after thanking their temporary host, a farmer
named Bloise, "can you tell us anything about an old cabin that stands
back there?" and he indicated the location of the mysterious shack.
</P>

<P>
"Well, yes, I can tell you a little about it, but not very much," said
Mr. Bloise. "It was built, some years ago, by a rich New Yorker, who
bought up a lot of land around here for a game preserve. But it didn't
pan out. This cabin was only the start of what he was going to call a
'hunting lodge,' I believe it was.  There was to be a big building on
the same order, but it never was built.
</P>

<P>
"Some say the fellow lost all his money in Wall Street, and others say
the state wouldn't let him make a game preserve here.  However it was,
the thing petered out, and the old shack hasn't been used since."
</P>

<P>
"Oh, yes, it has!" exclaimed Tom. "We just came from there, and there
are signs which show some one has been sleeping there and eating there."
</P>

<P>
"There has!" exclaimed the farmer. "Well, I didn't know that."
</P>

<P>
"I did," said his son, a young man about Tom's age. "I meant to speak
of it the other day. I saw an automobile turn into the old road that
the men used when they built the shack. I thought it was kind of queer
to see a touring car turn in there, and I meant to speak of it, but I
forgot. Yes, some one has been at the old cabin lately."
</P>

<P>
"Do you know who they are?" asked Tom eagerly. "We are looking for a
Mr. Nestor, who disappeared mysteriously about two weeks ago, and I
just found his wallet there in the shack!"
</P>

<P>
"You did!" exclaimed Mr. Bloise. "That's queer! You relatives of this
Mr. Nestor?" he asked.
</P>

<P>
"Not exactly," Tom answered. "Just very close friends."
</P>

<P>
"Well, it's too bad about his being missing in that way," went on the
farmer. "I read about it in the paper, but I never suspected he was
around here."
</P>

<P>
"Oh, we're not sure that he was," said Tom quickly. "Finding his wallet
doesn't prove that," and he told the story of his own and Jackson's
appearance on the scene, to the no small wonder of the farmer and his
family. Tom said nothing about the finding of the files, nor the
evidence he deduced from them. That was another matter to be taken up
later.
</P>

<P>
"Who were in the auto you saw?" asked Tom of the farmer's son.  "Was
Mr. Nestor in the car?"
</P>

<P>
"I couldn't be sure of that. There were two men in the machine, and
they were both strangers to me. They were talking together, pretty
earnestly, it seemed to me."
</P>

<P>
"One did not appear as if he was being taken away against his will, did
he?" asked Tom.
</P>

<P>
"No, I can't say that he did," was the answers "They looked to me, and
acted like, business men looking over land, or something like that.
They just turned in on the road that leads to the old hunting cabin, as
we call it around here, and didn't pay any attention to me. Then I
forgot all about them."
</P>

<P>
"Neither of them could have been Mr. Nestor," decided Tom. "At least it
doesn't seem as if he'd talk at all companionably to a man who had
treated him as we think Mr. Nestor has been treated.  I guess that clew
isn't going to amount to much."
</P>

<P>
"It may!" insisted Jackson. "They may have had Mr. Nestor in the car
all the while&mdash;concealed in the back you know. We've got to find out
more about these men and their auto, Tom."
</P>

<P>
"Well, yes, perhaps we have. But how?"
</P>

<P>
"Station some one at the shack, or at the beginning of the private
road. The men may come back."
</P>

<P>
"That's so&mdash;they may. We'll do that!" cried the young inventor.  "We
must tell the police and Mr. Nestor's folks what we have learned. How
can we get back to Shopton in a hurry?" he asked the farmer.
</P>

<P>
"Well, I can drive you to the railroad station," was the answer.
</P>

<P>
"Thank you," remarked Tom. "We'll accept your offer. And as soon as we
get back we must send some one from the shop to stand guard over the
airship," he added in an aside to Jackson. "Those file fellows may come
back."
</P>

<P>
"That's so, we can't take any chances."
</P>

<P>
The farmer soon had his team at the door, and, after they had had a
hasty but satisfying supper at the farmhouse, the son drove Tom and
Jackson several miles to a railroad station, where they could catch a
train for Shopton.
</P>

<P>
In due season Tom's home was reached. He intended to stop but a minute,
to assure his father that everything was all right, and then get out
his speedy runabout to go to see Mary, to tell her the news.
</P>

<P>
But when Tom sought his father in the library, he was told that there
was a visitor in the house.
</P>

<P>
"Tom," said his father, "this gentleman is from Washington. He wants to
arrange for a government test of your silent airship. I told him I
thought you were about ready for it."
</P>

<P>
"A government test!" cried Tom. "Why, I didn't think the government
even knew I was working on such an idea!" Tom was greatly surprised.
</P>

<H3 ALIGN="center">
CHAPTER XXIV
</H3>

<H3 ALIGN="center">
IN THE MOONLIGHT
</H3>

<P>
With a reassuring smile the visitor from Washington looked at Tom Swift.
</P>

<P>
"The government officials," he said, "know more than some people give
them credit for&mdash;especially in these war times. Our intelligence bureau
and secret service has been much enlarged of late. But don't be
alarmed, Mr. Swift," went on the caller, whose name was Mr. Blair
Terrill. "Your secret is safe with the government, but I think the time
is ripe to use it now&mdash;that is, if you have perfected it to a point
where we can use it."
</P>

<P>
"Yes," answered Tom slowly, "the invention is practically finished and
it is a success, except for a few minor matters that will not take long
to complete.
</P>

<P>
"Our accident this afternoon had nothing to do with the efficiency of
the silencer," Tom went on. "It was deliberately damaged by some spy.
I'll take that up later. That I am interested to know how you heard of
my Air Scout, as I call it."
</P>

<P>
"Well, we have agents, you know, watching all the inventors who have
helped us in times past, and we haven't forgotten your giant cannon or
big searchlight. I might say, to end your curiosity and lull your
suspicions, that your friend, Ned Newton, who has been doing such good
Liberty Bond work, informed us of your progress on the silent motor."
</P>

<P>
"Oh, so it was Ned!" exclaimed Tom.
</P>

<P>
"Yes. He told us the time was about ripe for us to make you an offer
for your machine. I think we can use it to great advantage in scout
work on the western front," went on the agent, and he soon convinced
Tom that when it came to a knowledge of airships, he had some very
pertinent facts at his disposal.
</P>

<P>
"When can you give me a test?" Mr. Terrill asked Tom.
</P>

<P>
"As soon as I can get my craft back to the shop and fit on a new outer
case. That won't take long, as I have some spare ones.  But I must help
the Nestors," he went on, speaking to his father.  "I didn't mention it
over the wire," he added, "but we've found in the cabin a clew to the
missing man. I must tell Mary and her mother, and help them all I can."
</P>

<P>
"And allow me to help, too," begged Mr. Terrill. "Since this affects
you, Mr. Swift, and since you are, in a way, working for Uncle Sam, you
must let him help you. This is the first I have heard of the missing
gentleman, of whom your father just told me something, but you must
allow me to help search for him. I will get the United States Secret
Service at work."
</P>

<P>
"That will be fine!" cried Tom. "I wanted to get their aid, but I
didn't see how I could, as I knew they were too busy with army matters
and tracing seditious alien enemies, to bother with private cases. I'm
sure the Secret Service men can get trace of the persons responsible
for the detention of Mr. Nestor, wherever he is."
</P>

<P>
"They'll do their best," said Mr. Terrill. "I'm a member of that body,"
he went on, "and I'll give my personal attention to the matter."
</P>

<P>
Then followed a busy time. Tom did not get to bed until nearly morning.
For he had to arrange to send some of his men to guard the stranded
airship, and then he went to see Mary and her mother, taking them the
good news that the search for Mr. Nestor would be prosecuted with
unprecedented vigor.
</P>

<P>
"If it isn't too late!" sadly said the missing man's wife.
</P>

<P>
"Oh, I'm sure it isn't!" declared Tom.
</P>

<P>
In addition to sending a guard to the airship, other men, some of them
hastily summoned from the nearest federal agency, were sent to keep
watch in the vicinity of the lonely cabin. They had orders to arrest
whoever approached, and a relay of the men was provided, so that watch
could be kept up night and day. Besides this, other men from the Secret
Service began scouring the country around the locality of the cabin,
seeking a trace of the two persons the farmer's son had seen in the
automobile.
</P>

<P>
"If Mr. Nestor is to be found, they'll find him!" declared Tom Swift.
</P>

<P>
Mr. Damon, as might be expected, was very much excited and wrought up
over all these happenings.
</P>

<P>
"Bless my watch chain, Tom Swift!" cried the eccentric man, "but
something is always happening to you. And to think I wasn't along when
this latest happened!"
</P>

<P>
"Well, you can be in at the finish," promised Tom, and it was strange
how his promise was fulfilled.
</P>

<P>
Meanwhile there was much to do. During the time the Secret Service men
were busy looking up clews which might lead to the finding of Mr.
Nestor and keeping watch in the vicinity of the hut, Tom had his
airship brought back to the hangar, and a new silencer was attached.
While this work was going on the place was guarded night and day by
responsible men, so there was no chance for an enemy spy to get in and
do further damage.
</P>

<P>
An investigation was made of the Universal Flying Machine Company, but
nothing could be proved to link them with the outrage. Gale and Ware
were in Europe&mdash;ostensibly on government business, but it was said that
if anything could be proved connecting them with the attempt made on
Tom Swift's craft, they would be deprived of all official contracts and
punished.
</P>

<P>
All this took time, and the waits were wearisome, particularly in the
case of Mr. Nestor. No further trace of him was found, though every
effort was made. Tom began to feel that his boast of his enemies having
to get up early in the morning to get ahead of him, had been premature,
to say the least.
</P>

<P>
Tom Swift worked hard on his new Air Scout. He determined there would
be nothing lacking when it came to the government test, and not only
did he make sure that no enemy could tamper with his machine, but he
took pains to see that no inherent defect would mar the test.
</P>

<P>
Jackson and the other men helped to the best of their ability, and Mr.
Swift suggested some improvements which were incorporated in the new
machine.
</P>

<P>
One of the puzzles the Secret Service men had to solve was that of the
connection, if any, between the men who had to do with the missing Mr.
Nestor and those who had damaged Tom's airship by filing the muffler
case so it was weakened and burst. That there was some connection Tom
was certain, but he could not work it out, nor, so far, had the
government men.
</P>

<P>
At last the day came when the big government test was to be made. Tom
had completed his Air Scout and had refined it to a point where even
his critical judgment was satisfied. All that remained now was to give
Mr. Terrill a chance to see how silently the big craft could fly, and
to this end a flight was arranged.
</P>

<P>
Tom had put the silencer on a larger machine than the one he and
Jackson had used. It held three easily, and, on a pinch, four could be
carried. Tom's plan was to take Mr. Damon and Mr. Terrill, fly with
them for some time in the air, and demonstrate how quiet his new craft
was. Then, by contrast, a machine without the muffler and the new motor
with its improved propellers would be flown, making as much noise as
the usual craft did.
</P>

<P>
"I only wish," said Tom, as the time arrived for the official
government test, "that Mary could be here to see it. She was the one
who really started me on this idea, so to speak, as it was because I
couldn't talk to her that I decided to get up a silent motor."
</P>

<P>
But Mary Nestor was too grief-stricken over her missing father to come
to the test, which was to take place late one afternoon, starting from
the aerodrome of the Swift plant.
</P>

<P>
"First," said Tom, to Mr. Terrill, "I'll show you how the machine works
on the ground. I'll run the motor while the plane is held down by means
of ropes and blocks. Then we'll go up in it."
</P>

<P>
"That suits me," said the agent. "If it does all you say it will do,
and as much as I believe it will do, Uncle Sam will be your debtor, Mr.
Swift."
</P>

<P>
"Well, we'll see," said Tom with a smile.
</P>

<P>
Preparations were made with the greatest care, and Tom went over every
detail of the machine twice to make certain that, in spite of the
precautions, no spy had done any hidden damage, that might be
manifested at an inopportune moment. But everything seemed all right,
and, finally, the motor was started, while Mr. Terrill, and some of his
colleagues from the Army Aviation department looked on.
</P>

<P>
"Contact!" cried Tom, as Jackson indicated that the compression had
been made.
</P>

<P>
The mechanic nodded, gave the big propeller blades a quarter turn and
jumped back. In an instant the motor was operating, and the craft would
have leaped forward and cleaved the air but for the holding ropes and
blocks. Tom speeded the machinery up to almost the last notch, but
those in the aerodrome hardly heard a sound. It was as though some
great, silent dynamo were working.
</P>

<P>
"Fine!"
</P>

<P>
"Wonderful!"
</P>

<P>
"Wouldn't have believed it possible!"
</P>

<P>
These were some of the comments of the government inspectors.
</P>

<P>
"And now for the final test&mdash;that in the air," said Mr. Terrill.
</P>

<P>
Previous to this he and his colleagues had made a minute examination of
the machinery, and had been shown the interior construction of the
silencer by means of one built so that a sectional view could be had.
Tom's principles were pronounced fundamental and simple.
</P>

<P>
"So simple, in fact, that it is a wonder no one thought of it before,"
said a navy aviation expert. "It is the last word in aircraft
construction&mdash;a silent motor that will not apprise the enemy of its
approach! You have done wonders, Mr. Swift!"
</P>

<P>
"I'd rather hear you say that after the air test," replied Tom, with a
laugh. "Are you ready, Mr. Terrill?"
</P>

<P>
"Whenever you are."
</P>

<P>
"How about you, Mr. Damon?"
</P>

<P>
"Oh, I'm always ready to go with you, Tom Swift. Bless my trench
helmet, but you can't sail any too soon for me!"
</P>

<P>
There was a genial laugh at his impetuosity, and the three took their
seats in the big craft. Once more the engine was started.  It operated
as silently as before, and the first good impressions were confirmed.
Even as the machine moved along the ground, just previous to taking
flight into the air, there was no noise, save the slight crunch made by
the wheels. This, of course, would be obviated when Silent Sam was
aloft.
</P>

<P>
Up and up soared the great craft, with Tom at the engine and guide
controls, while Mr. Terrill and Mr. Damon sat behind him, both eagerly
watching. Mr. Terrill was there to find fault if he could, but he was
glad he did not have to.
</P>

<P>
"The machine works perfectly, Mr. Swift," he said. "My report cannot be
otherwise than favorable."
</P>

<P>
"We mustn't be in too much of a hurry," said Tom, who had learned
caution some time ago. "I want to sail around for several hours.
Sometimes a machine will work well at first, but defects will develop
when it is overheated. I'm going to do my best to make a noise with
this new motor."
</P>

<P>
But it seemed impossible. The machinery worked perfectly, and though
Silent Sam took his passengers high and low, in big circles and small
ones, there was no appreciable noise from the motor. The passengers
could converse as easily, and with as little effort, as in a balloon.
</P>

<P>
"Of course that isn't the prime requisite," said Mr. Terrill, "but it
is a good one. What we want is a machine that can sail over the enemy's
lines at night without being heard, and I think this one will do it&mdash;in
fact, I'm sure it will. Of course the ability of the passengers to
converse and not have to use the uncertain tube is a great advantage."
</P>

<P>
As Tom Swift sailed on and on, it became evident that the test was
going to be a success. The afternoon passed, and it began to grow dark,
but a glorious full moon came up.
</P>

<P>
"Shall I take you down?" the young inventor asked Mr. Terrill.
</P>

<P>
"Not quite yet. I thoroughly enjoy this, and it isn't often I get a
chance for a moonlight airship ride. Go a little lower, if you please,
and we'll see if we attract any attention from the inhabitants of the
earth. We'll see if they can possibly hear the machine, though I don't
see how they can."
</P>

<P>
And they did not. Tom piloted the machine over Shopton, sailing
directly over the center of the town, where there was a big crowd
walking about. Though the airship sailed only a few hundred feet above
their heads, not a person was aware of it, since the craft's lights
were put out for this test.
</P>

<P>
"That settles it," said Mr. Terrill. "You have succeeded, Tom Swift!"
</P>

<P>
But Tom was not yet satisfied. He wanted a longer test. Hardly knowing
why he did it he sent the craft in the direction of Mary Nestor's home.
As he sailed across her lawn he saw, in the moonlight, that she and her
mother were walking in the garden.  They did not look up as the
aircraft passed over their heads, and were totally unaware of its
presence, unless they caught a glimpse of it as it flitted silently
along, like some great bird of the night.
</P>

<P>
"It is perfectly wonderful!" declared Mr. Terrill, and he spoke in
ordinary tones, that carried perfectly to the ears of Tom and Mr. Damon.
</P>

<P>
"Wonderful!" cried the eccentric man. "Bless my chimney, but it's the
greatest invention in the world! Yes, it is! Don't tell me it 'isn't!"
</P>

<P>
And no one did.
</P>

<P>
Passing the Nestor home, the saddened occupants of which were unaware
of the passage, Tom sent the Air Scout about in a circle, intending to
proceed to the hangar. And then, some whim, perhaps, caused him to
guide Silent Sam out toward the lonely hut. Mr. Damon and Mr. Tenrill
seemed perfectly content to sail on and on indefinitely in the
moonlight. Tom thought he would take them over a lonely neighborhood,
and then bring them back.
</P>

<P>
In a little while the craft was directly over the stretch of country
where the aeroplane accident had occurred, and where Tom and Jackson
had found the deserted hut.
</P>

<P>
Rather idly Tom looked down, wondering if the Secret Service men were
on the watch and if they had discovered anything.
</P>

<P>
Suddenly Tom was aware of an automobile moving along the field path
toward the cabin. There were two men in the car, both on the front
seat, and as Tom looked down the brilliant moonlight showed him the
figure of another man, behind, and huddled in the tonneau of the car.
The aeroplane was low enough for all these details to be seen by the
moon's gleam, but the men in the car, not hearing any noise, did not
look up, so they were unconscious of this aerial espionage.
</P>

<P>
"Look! Look!" exclaimed Tom in a low voice to his companions.  "Doesn't
that seem suspicious?"
</P>

CHAPTER XXV
</H3>

<H3 ALIGN="center">
THE GOLD TOOTH
</H3>

<P>
Eagerly Mr. Damon and the government agent leaned over and looked down.
In the moonlight they saw the same sight that had attracted Tom Swift.
The touring car, the two men in front, and the huddled, bound figure in
the back.
</P>

<P>
"Can you go down, Tom, without letting them hear you?" asked Mr. Damon,
using a low voice, as if fearful the men in the automobile would hear
him.
</P>

<P>
"I guess so," answered the young inventor. "I can land nearer to the
cabin than Jackson and I did, and then we can see what these fellows
are up to. It looks suspicious to me. That is, unless they're some of
the Secret Service men, and have made a capture," he added to Mr.
Terrill.
</P>

<P>
"Those aren't any of Uncle Sam's men," declared the agent.  "That is,
unless the bound one is. I can't see him very well.  Better go down,
and we'll see if we can surprise them."
</P>

<P>
"My plan," voiced Tom.
</P>

<P>
Quickly he shifted the rudder, and then, shutting off the motor, as he
wanted to volplane down, he headed his craft for an open spot that
showed in the bright moonlight. By this time the automobile and its
occupants were out of sight behind a clump of trees, but Tom and his
companions felt sure of the destination of the men&mdash;the deserted cabin
in the wood.
</P>

<P>
As silently as a wisp of grass falling, the big craft came down on a
level spot, and then, leaping out, the young inventor and his two
companions crept along the path toward the cabin. Mr. Terrill was
armed, Tom carried a flashlight, while Mr. Damon picked up a heavy club.
</P>

<P>
As soon as he came near a place where he thought the marks of the
automobile wheels would show, Tom flashed his light.
</P>

<P>
"I thought so!" he exclaimed, as he saw the square, knobby tread marks
left by the tires. "It's the same gang, or some of them in the same
car. If we can only capture them!"
</P>

<P>
"The Secret Service men ought to do that," returned Mr. Terrill, but,
as it developed later, they were not on hand, though through no fault
of theirs.
</P>

<P>
On and on crept Tom and the two men, until they came within sight of
the cabin. They saw a light gleaming in it, and Tom whispered:
</P>

<P>
"Now we have them! Work our way up quietly and make them surrender, if
we find they're what we think."
</P>

<P>
"Is there a rear door?" asked Mr. Terrill in a whisper.
</P>

<P>
Tom answered in the negative, and then all three, in fan shape, crept
up to the front portal. It was open, and silently reaching a place
where they could make an observation, Tom and his companions looked in.
</P>

<P>
What they saw filled them with wild and righteous rage, and brought to
an end the mystery of the disappearance of Mr. Nestor.  For there he
sat, bound in a chair, and at a table in front of him were two
forbidding-looking men.
</P>

<P>
"What do you intend to do now?" asked Mr. Nestor in a faint voice. "I
cannot stand this captivity much longer. You admit that you don't want
me&mdash;that you never wanted me&mdash;so why do you keep me a prisoner? It
cannot do the least good."
</P>

<P>
"There's no use going over that again!" exclaimed the harsh voice of
one of the men. "We told you that if you will promise to keep still
about what happened to you, and not to give the police any information
about us, we'll let you go gladly. We don't want you. It was all a
mistake, capturing you. You were the wrong man. But we're not going to
let you go and have you set the police on us as soon as you get a
chance. Give us your promise to say nothing, and we'll let you join
your friends. If you don't&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
"Make no promises, Mr. Nestor!" cried Tom Swift in a ringing voice, as
he leaped from his hiding place, followed by his companions. "Your
friends are here, and you can tell them everything!"
</P>

<P>
"Up with 'em!" called Mr. Terrill to the two conspirators as he
confronted them with his automatic pistol ready for firing. He had no
need to mention hands&mdash;they knew what he meant and took the
characteristic attitude.
</P>

<P>
"Tom! Tom Swift!" cried Mr. Nestor, struggling ineffectually at his
bonds. "Is it really you?"
</P>

<P>
"Well, I hope it isn't any imitation," was the grim answer.  "We'll
tell you all about it later. Jove, but I'm glad we found you! If it
hadn't been for Silent Sam we might never have been able to."
</P>

<P>
"Well, I don't know who Silent Sam is," said Mr. Nestor faintly. "But
I'm sure I'm much obliged to him and your other friends. It has been
very hard. Tell me, are my wife and Mary all right?"
</P>

<P>
"In good health, yes, but, of course, worrying," said Tom. "We saw them
in the garden a little while ago. Now don't talk until I set you free."
</P>

<P>
And as Tom cut the ropes from Mr. Nestor, Mr. Damon used them to bind
the two conspirators, while Mr. Terrill stood guard over them. And when
they were safely bound, and Mr. Nestor had somewhat recovered from the
shock, Tom had a chance to examine the prisoners.
</P>

<P>
"What does it all mean? Who are you fellows, anyhow, and what's your
game?" he demanded.
</P>

<P>
"Guess it&mdash;since you're so smart!" snapped one.
</P>

<P>
And no sooner had he opened his mouth and Tom had a glance of something
gleaming brightly yellow, than the young inventor cried:
</P>

<P>
"The gold tooth! So it's you again, is it, you spy?"
</P>

<P>
The man shrugged his shoulders with an assumption of indifference. And,
as Tom took a closer look, he became aware that the man was surely none
other than Lydane, the spy he had chased into the mud puddle some weeks
before. His companion was a stranger to Tom.
</P>

<P>
"What does it all mean, Mr. Nestor?" asked Tom. "Have these men held
you a prisoner ever since you called for help on the moor that night?"
</P>

<P>
"Yes, Tom, they have. And I did call for help after they attacked me as
I was riding my wheel, but I didn't know any one heard me. I began to
be afraid no one would ever help me."
</P>

<P>
"We've been trying to, a long time," said Mr. Damon, "but we couldn't
find you. Where did they keep you?"
</P>

<P>
"Here, part of the time," was Mr. Nestor's answer. "And in other lonely
houses. They bound and gagged me when they took me from place to place."
</P>

<P>
"But what was their object?" asked Tom, concluding it was useless to
question the two captives. "Why did they make you a prisoner, Mr.
Nestor?"
</P>

<P>
"Because they took me for you, Tom."
</P>

<P>
"For me?"
</P>

<P>
"Yes. The night I called at your house, and found you were not at home,
I put back in my pocket a bundle of papers I had brought over to show
you. They were plans of a little kitchen appliance a friend of mine had
invented, and I wanted to ask your opinion of it."
</P>

<P>
"These scoundrels must have followed me, or have seen the bundle of
papers, and, mistaking me for you, they followed, attacked me in a
lonely spot and, bundling me and my wrecked wheel into an auto, carried
me off. They first demanded that I gave up the 'plans,' and when I
wouldn't they choked off my cries for help and knocked me into
unconsciousness. Then they brought me here, and kept me here for
several days.
</P>

<P>
"They soon learned that the plans I had weren't those they wanted,
though what they were then after I couldn't imagine.  Only, from what I
later overheard, I knew they mistook me for you and that they were
bitterly disappointed in not getting plans of some new airship you were
working on. They have kept me a prisoner ever since, and though they
offered to let me go if I would keep silent, I refused. I did not
think, to secure my own comfort, I should let such men go unpunished if
I could bring about their arrest."
</P>

<P>
"I should say not!" cried Tom.
</P>

<P>
"Did they treat you brutally, Mr. Nestor?" asked Mr. Damon.
</P>

<P>
"Not after they found out who I was, by looking through my wallet. Of
course they didn't behave very decently, but they weren't actually
cruel, except that they bound and gagged me. Oh, but I'm glad you came,
Tom! How did it happen?"
</P>

<P>
Then they told Mr. Nestor their story, and how the test of the new Air
Scout had led to his rescue.
</P>

<P>
"But where are the Secret Service men?" asked Mr. Terrill, when it
became evident that none them was on guard at the cabin.
</P>

<P>
Later it developed that, by following a false clew, the Secret Service
men had been drawn miles away from the cabin. And only that Tom and his
companions in the silent airship saw the men.  Mr. Nestor might not
have been rescued for some further time.
</P>

<P>
His version of what had happened was correct. He had been mistaken for
Tom, and the spy with the gold tooth and his accomplice had waylaid
Mary's father, under the belief that it was Tom Swift with the plans of
the new silent motor. Mr. Nestor had been attacked while riding his
wheel in a lonely place, and had been carried off and kept in hiding, a
prisoner even after his identity became known.
</P>

<P>
"Well, this is a good night's work!" exclaimed Tom, when the two rogues
had been sent to jail and Mr. Nestor taken to the Bloise farmhouse, to
be refreshed before he went home. Word of his rescue was telephoned to
Mary and her mother, and it can be imagined how they regarded Tom Swift
for his part in the affair.
</P>

<P>
Little the worse for his experience, save that he was very nervous, Mr.
Nestor was taken home. He gave the details of his being waylaid, and
told how the men, for many days, were at their wits' ends to keep him
concealed when they found what a stir his disappearance had created.
The conspirators were well supplied with money, and in the automobile
they took their prisoner from one place to another. They had usurped
the use of the cabin and had lived there nearly a week in hiding,
leaving just before the first visit of Tom and Jackson. The rifled
wallet had been dropped by accident.
</P>

<P>
And it did not take much delving to disclose the fact that, Lydane,
"Gold Tooth," as he was called, and his crony, were spies in the pay of
the Universal Flying Machine Company. As the men went under several
aliases there is no need of giving their names. It is to be doubted if
they ever used their real ones&mdash;or if they had any.
</P>

<P>
Of course, there was quite a sensation when Mr. Nestor was found, and a
greater one when it became known the part the Universal Flying Machine
people had in his disappearance in mistake for Tom. The officials of
the company were indicted, and several of the minor ones sent to jail
but Gale and Ware escaped by remaining abroad.
</P>

<P>
It came out that they both knew of the acts of Lydane and his companion
in crime, and that the two officials realized the mistake that had been
made by their clumsy operatives. It was believed that this knowledge
led to the visit of Gale to Tom, the time the latter's suspicions were
first aroused. Gale made a clumsy attempt to clear his own skirts of
the conspiracy, but in vain, though he did escape his just punishment.
</P>

<P>
What had happened, in brief, was this. Gale and Ware, unable to secure
Tom's services, even by the offer of a large sum of money, had stooped
to the sending of spies to his shop, to get possession of information
about his silent motor. This was after Gale had, by accident, heard Tom
speaking of it to Mr. Damon.
</P>

<P>
But, thanks to Tom's vigilance, Bower was discovered. The man tripped
into the mud hole lost in the muck the plans Bower passed to him. They
were never recovered. Then Lydane tried again. He managed, through
bribery, to gain access to the hangar where the new silent machine was
kept, and, unable to get the silencer apart, tried to file it. In doing
so he weakened it so that it burst.
</P>

<P>
The attempt to waylay Tom, and so get the plans from him, had been
tried before this, only a mistake had been made, and Mr. Nestor was
caught instead. Finding out their error, Lydane and his companions did
not tell the Universal people of their mistake, though Gale and Ware
knew the attempt was to be made against Tom Swift.
</P>

<P>
Later, hearing that the young inventor was still at work on his
invention, Gale was much surprised, and paid his queer visit, in an
attempt to repudiate the actions of Lydane. At this time it was assumed
that Gale and his partner did not know that it was Mr. Nestor who had
been kidnapped by mistake or they might have insisted on his release.
As it was, Lydane had Mary's father, and was afraid to let him go,
though really their prisoner became a white elephant on the hands of
the conspirators and kidnappers.
</P>

<P>
And it was after all this was cleared up, and Mr. Nestor restored to
his family and friends, that one day, Tom Swift received another visit
from Mr. Terrill, the government agent.
</P>

<P>
"Well, Mr. Swift," was the genial greeting, "I have come to tell you
that the favorable report made by my friends and myself as to the
performance of your noiseless motor, has been accepted by the War
Department, and I have come to ask what your terms are. For how much
will you sell your patent to the United States?"
</P>

<P>
Tom Swift arose.
</P>

<P>
"The United States hasn't money enough to buy my patent of a noiseless
motor," he said.
</P>

<P>
"Wha&mdash;what!" faltered Mr. Terrill. "Why, I understood&mdash;you don't
mean&mdash;they told me you were rather patriotic, and&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
"I hope I am patriotic!" interrupted Tom with a smile. "And when I say
that the United States hasn't money enough to buy my latest invention I
mean just that."
</P>

<P>
"My Air Scout is not for sale!"
</P>

<P>
"You mean," faltered the government agent. "You say&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
"I mean," went on Tom, "that Silent Sam is for Uncle Sam without one
cent of cost! My father and I take great pleasure in presenting such
machines as are already manufactured, those in process of making, and
the entire patents, and all other rights, to the government for the
winning of the war!"
</P>

<P>
"Oh!" said Mr. Terrill in rather a strange voice. "Oh!"
</P>

<P>
And that was all he could say for a little while.
</P>

<P>
But Tom Swift reckoned without a knowledge of a peculiar law which
prohibits the United States from accepting gifts totally without
compensation, and so, in due season, the young inventor received a
check for the sum of one dollar in full payment for his silent motor,
and the patent rights thereto. And Tom has that check framed, and
hanging over his desk.
</P>

<P>
And so the silent motor became an accomplished fact and a great
success. Those of you who have read of its work against the Boches, and
how it helped Uncle Sam to gain the mastery of the sky, need not be
reminded of this. By it many surprise attacks were made, and much
valuable information was obtained that otherwise could not have been
brought in.
</P>

<P>
One day, after the rogues had been sent to prison for long terms, and
Tom had turned over to his government his silent aircraft&mdash;except one
which he was induced to keep for his own personal use&mdash;the young
inventor went to call on Mary Nestor. The object of his call, as I
believe he stated it, was to see how Mr. Nestor was, but that, of
course, was camouflage.
</P>

<P>
"Would you like to come for a ride, Mary, in the silent airship?" asked
Tom, after he had paid his respects to Mr. Nestor and his wife. "We can
talk very easily on board Silent Sam without the use of a speaking
tube. Come on&mdash;we'll go for a moonlight sky ride."
</P>

<P>
"It sounds enticing," said Mary, with a shy look at Tom. "But wouldn't
you just as soon sit on a bench in the garden? It's moonlight there,
and we can talk, and&mdash;and&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
"I'd just as soon!" said Tom quickly.
</P>

<P>
And out they went into the beautiful moonlight; and here we will leave
them and say good-bye.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
